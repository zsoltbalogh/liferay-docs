# Theme [](id=theme)

The Theme sample provides the base files for a theme, using the
[Theme Builder Gradle plugin](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/theme-builder-gradle-plugin).

When deploying this sample with no customizations, a theme based off of the 
`_styled` base theme is created. For more information on themes, visit the 
[Introduction to Themes](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/introduction-to-themes)
tutorial.

To modify this sample, add the `images`, `js`, or `templates` directory, along
with your modified files, to the `src/main/webapp` directory. The sample already
provides the `src/main/resources/resources-importer`, `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF`,
and `src/main/webapp/css` directories for you. Add your style modifications to
the provided `css/_custom.scss` file. For a complete explanation of a theme's
files, see the
[Theme Reference Guide](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/theme-reference-guide).
