# Sample Modules [](id=sample-modules)

Liferay provides sample modules that target different integration points in
@product@. These modules reside in the
[liferay-blade-samples](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples)
Github repository and can be easily copy/pasted to your local environment. The
sample modules are grouped into five different parent folders based on the build
tools used to generate them:

- `liferay-gradle`
- `liferay-workspace`
- `maven`

**Note:** This section of articles does not provide documentation for *all*
sample modules residing in the `liferay-blade-samples` repo. The documentation
for these samples is in progress and will grow over time.
