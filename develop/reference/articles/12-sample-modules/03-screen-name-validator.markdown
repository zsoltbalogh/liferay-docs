# Screen Name Validator [](id=screen-name-validator)

The Screen Name Validator sample provides a way to validate a user's inputted
screen name. During validation, the screen name is tested client-side and
server-side.

This sample checks if a user's screen name contains reserved words that are
configured in the *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System
Settings* &rarr; *Foundation* &rarr; *ScreenName Validator* menu. The default
values for the screen name validator's reserved words are *admin* and *user*.

`com.liferay.blade.samples.screenname.validator.internal.CustomScreenNameValidator`
class.

You can also customize this sample's configuration by adding more properties in
the
`com.liferay.blade.samples.screenname.validator.CustomScreenNameConfiguration`
class.
