*Liferay Faces Portal* is distributed in a `.jar` file. You can add Liferay
Faces Portal as a dependency for your portlet projects, in order to use its
Liferay-specific utilities and UI components. Liferay Faces Portal is included
in a JSF portlet project automatically when created using Liferay IDE/Developer
Studio. Examine Figure 1 below and notice you have a
`liferay-faces-portal-[version].jar` in your portlet's library.
