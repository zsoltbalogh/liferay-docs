## Features [](id=features)

DDL Form Screenlet shows a set of fields that can be filled in by the user. 
Initial or existing values can be shown in the fields. Fields of the following 
data types are supported:

- *Boolean*: A two state value typically represented by a checkbox.
- *Date*: A formatted date value. The format depends on the device's current 
  locale.
- *Decimal, Integer, and Number*: A numeric value.
- *Documents & Media*: A file stored on the device. It can be uploaded to a 
  specific portal repository.
- *Radio*: A set of options to choose from. A single option must be chosen. 
- *Select*: A selection box of options to choose from. A single option must be 
  chosen.
- *Text*: A single line of text.
- *Text Area*: Multiple lines of text.

The DDL Form Screenlet also supports the following features:

- Stored records can support a specific workflow.
- A Submit button can be shown at the end of the form.
- Required values and validation for fields can be used. 
- Users can traverse the form fields from the keyboard.
- Supports i18n in record values and labels.

There are also a few limitations that you should be aware of when using DDL Form 
Screenlet. They are listed here:

- Nested fields in the data definition aren't supported.
- Selection of multiple items in the Radio and Select data types isn't 
  supported.

## Module [](id=module)

- DDL

## Views [](id=views)

- Default
- Material

The Default View uses a standard vertical `ScrollView` to show a scrollable list 
of fields. Other Views may use different components, such as `ViewPager` or 
others, to show the fields. You can find a sample of this implementation in the 
`DDLFormScreenletPagerView` class.

![Figure 1: DDL Form Screenlet's Default (left) and Material (right) Views.](../../images/screens-android-ddlform.png)

### Editor Types [](id=editor-types)

Each field defines an editor type. You must define each editor type's layout by 
using the following attributes:

- `checkboxFieldLayoutId`: The layout to use for Boolean fields.
- `dateFieldLayoutId`: The layout to use for Date fields.
- `numberFieldLayoutId`: The layout to use for Number, Decimal, or Integer 
  fields.
- `radioFieldLayoutId`: The layout to use for Radio fields.
- `selectFieldLayoutId`: The layout to use for Select fields.
- `textFieldLayoutId`: The layout to use for Text fields.
- `textAreaFieldLayoutId`: The layout to use for Text Box fields.
- `textDocumentFieldLayoutId`: The layout to use for Documents &amp; Media 
  fields.

If you don't define the editor type's layout in DDL Form Screenlet's attributes, 
the default layout `ddlfield_xxx_default` is used, where `xxx` is the name of 
the editor type. It's important to note that you can change the layout used with 
any editor type at any point. 

### Custom Editors [](id=custom-editors)

If you want to have a unique appearance for one specific field, you can
customize your field's editor View by calling the Screenlet's
`setCustomFieldLayoutId(fieldName, layoutId)` method, where the first parameter
is the name of the field to customize and the second parameter is the layout to
use. You can also create custom editor Views. For examples of this, see the
files `ddlfield_custom_rating_number.xml` and `CustomRatingNumberView.java`.

## Activity Configuration [](id=activity-configuration)

DDL Form Screenlet needs the following user permissions:

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

Both are used by the Documents and Media fields to take a picture/video and 
store it locally before uploading it to the portal. The Documents and Media 
fields also need to override the `onActivityResult` method to receive the 
picture/video information. Here's an example implementation: 

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    
        _screenlet.startUploadByPosition(requestCode);
    }

## Portal Configuration [](id=portal-configuration)

Before using DDL Form Screenlet, you should make sure that Dynamic Data Lists 
and Data Types are configured properly in the portal. Refer to the 
[Creating Data Definitions](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-data-definitions) 
and 
[Creating Data Lists](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-data-lists) 
sections of the User Guide for more details. If Workflow is required, it must 
also be configured. See the 
[Using Workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-workflow) 
section of the User Guide for details. 

### Permissions [](id=permissions)

To use DDL Form Screenlet to add new records, you must grant the Add Record 
permission in the Dynamic Data List in the portal. If you want to use DDL Form 
Screenlet to view or edit record values, you must also grant the View and Update 
permissions, respectively. The Add Record, View, and Update permissions are 
highlighted by the red boxes in the following screenshot:

![Figure 2: The permissions for adding, viewing, and editing DDL records.](../../images/screens-portal-permission-ddl.png)

Also, if your form includes at least one Documents and Media field, you must 
grant permissions in the target repository and folder. For more details, see the 
`repositoryId` and `folderId` attributes below.

![Figure 3: The permission for adding a document to a Documents and Media folder.](../../images/screens-portal-permission-folder-add.png)

For more details, see the User Guide sections 
[Creating Data Definitions](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-data-definitions), 
[Creating Data Lists](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-data-lists), and 
[Using Workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-workflow). 

## Offline [](id=offline)

This Screenlet supports offline mode so it can function without a network 
connection. For more information on how offline mode works, see the 
[tutorial on its architecture](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/architecture-of-offline-mode-in-liferay-screens). 

When loading the form or record, the Screenlet supports the following offline 
mode policies:

| Policy | What happens | When to use |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| `REMOTE_ONLY` | The Screenlet loads the form or record from the portal. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. If the Screenlet loads the form or record, it stores the received data (record structure and data) in the local cache for later use. | Use this policy when you always need to show updated data, and show nothing when there's no connection. |
| `CACHE_ONLY` | The Screenlet loads the form or record from the local cache. If the form or record isn't there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy when you always need to show local data, without retrieving remote information under any circumstance. |
| `REMOTE_FIRST` | The Screenlet requests the form or record from the portal. The Screenlet shows the record or form to the user and stores it in the local cache for later use. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet retrieves the form or record from the local cache. If the form or record doesn't exist there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy to show the most recent version of the data when connected, but show an outdated version when there's no connection. |
| `CACHE_FIRST` | If the form or record exists in the local cache, the Screenlet loads it from there. If it doesn't exist there, the Screenlet requests it from the portal and notifies the developer about any errors that occur (including connectivity errors). | Use this policy to save bandwidth and loading time in case you have local (but probably outdated) data. |

When editing the record, the Screenlet supports the following offline mode 
policies:

| Policy | What happens | When to use |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| `REMOTE_ONLY` | The Screenlet sends the record to the portal. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error, but it also discards the record. | Use this policy to make sure the portal always has the most recent version of the record. |
| `CACHE_ONLY` | The Screenlet stores the record in the local cache. | Use this policy when you need to save the data locally, but don't want to update the data in the portal (update or add record). |
| `REMOTE_FIRST` | The Screenlet sends the record to the portal. If this succeeds, it also stores the record in the local cache for later usage. If a connection issue occurs, then Screenlet stores the record in the local cache with the *dirty flag* enabled. This causes the synchronization process to send the record to the portal when it runs. | Use this policy when you need to make sure the Screenlet sends the record to the portal as soon as the connection is restored. |
| `CACHE_FIRST` | The Screenlet stores the record in the local cache and then sends it to the remote portal. If a connection issue occurs, then Screenlet stores the record in the local cache with the *dirty flag* enabled. This causes the the synchronization process to send the record to the portal when it runs. | Use this policy when you need to make sure the Screenlet sends the record to the portal as soon as the connection is restored. Compared to `REMOTE_FIRST`, this policy always stores the record in the cache. The `REMOTE_FIRST` policy only stores the record in the event of a network error. |

| `textAreaFieldLayoutId` | `@layout` | The layout to use to show the view for Text Box fields. |
| `textDocumentFieldLayoutId` | `@layout` | The layout to use to show the view for Documents & Media fields. |
| `structureId` | `number` | The ID of a data definition in your Liferay site. To find the IDs for your data definitions, click *Admin* &rarr; *Content* from the Dockbar. Then click *Dynamic Data Lists* on the left and click the *Manage Data Definitions* button. The ID of each data definition is in the ID column of the table. |
| `groupId` | `number` | The ID of the site (group) where the record is stored. If this value is `0`, the `groupId` specified in `LiferayServerContext` is used. |
| `recordSetId` | `number` | A dynamic data list's ID. To find your dynamic data lists' IDs, click *Admin* &rarr; *Content* from the Dockbar. Then click *Dynamic Data Lists* on the left. Each dynamic data list's ID is in the ID column of the table. |
| `recordId` | `number` | The ID of the record you want to show. You can also allow the record's values to be edited. This ID can be obtained from other methods or listeners. |
| `repositoryId` | `number` | The ID of the Documents and Media repository to upload to. If this value is `0`, the default repository for the site specified by `groupId` is used. |
| `folderId` | `number` | The ID of the folder where Documents and Media files are uploaded. If this value is `0`, the root is used. |
| `filePrefix` | `string` | The prefix to attach to the names of files uploaded to a Documents and Media repository. The upload date followed by the original file name is appended following the prefix. |
| `autoLoad` | `boolean` | Sets whether the form loads when the Screenlet is shown. If `recordId` is set, the record value is loaded together with the form definition. The default value is `false`. |
| `autoScrollOnValidation` | `boolean` | Sets whether the form automatically scrolls to the first failed field when validation is used. The default value is `true`. |
| `showSubmitButton` | `boolean` | Sets whether the form shows a submit button at the bottom. If this is set to `false`, you should call the `submitForm()` method. The default value is `true`. |

## Methods [](id=methods)

| Method | Return Type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `loadForm()` | `void` | Starts the request to load the form definition. The form fields are shown when the response is received. |
| `loadRecord()` | `void` | Starts the request to load the record specified by `recordId`. If needed, the form definition also loads. When the response is received, the form fields are shown filled with record values. |
| `load()` | `void` | Starts the request to load the record if `recordId` is specified. Otherwise, the form definition is loaded. |
| `submitForm()` | `void` | Starts the request to submit form values to the dynamic data list specified by `recordSetId`. If the record is new, a new record is added. If `loadRecord` is used to retrieve the record, or the record already exists, its values are updated. Fields are validated prior to the request. If validation fails, the validation errors are shown and the request is terminated. |

## Listener [](id=listener)

DDL Form Screenlet delegates some events to an object that implements to the 
`DDLFormScreenletListener` interface. This interface lets you implement the 
following methods:

- `onDDLFormLoaded(Record record)`: Called when the form definition successfully 
  loads. 

- `onDDLFormRecordLoaded(Record record, Map<String, Object> valuesAndAttributes)`: 
  Called when the form record data successfully loads. 

- `onDDLFormRecordAdded(Record record)`: Called when the form record is 
  successfully added.

- `onDDLFormRecordUpdated(Record record)`: Called when the form record data 
  successfully updates.

- `error(Exception e, String userAction)`: Called when an error occurs in the 
  process. For example, this method is called when an error occurs while loading 
  a form definition or record, or adding or updating a record. The `userAction` 
  variable distinguishes these events. 

- `onDDLFormDocumentUploaded(DocumentField field)`: Called when a specified 
  document field's upload completes.

- `onDDLFormDocumentUploadFailed(DocumentField field, Exception e)`: Called when 
  a specified document field's upload fails.
