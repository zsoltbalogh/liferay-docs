# Asset Display Screenlet for iOS [](id=asset-display-screenlet-for-ios)

## Requirements [](id=requirements)

- Xcode 7.2
- iOS 9 SDK
- Liferay 7.0 CE, Liferay DXP 
- Liferay Screens Compatibility Plugin 
  ([CE](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/54365664) or 
  [DE](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/54369726), 
  depending on your Liferay edition). This app is preinstalled in Liferay 7.0 CE 
  and Liferay DXP instances. 

## Compatibility [](id=compatibility)

- iOS 8 and above

## Features [](id=features)

Asset Display Screenlet can display an asset from a Liferay instance. The 
Screenlet can currently display Documents and Media files (`DLFileEntry` images, 
videos, audio files, and PDFs), blogs entries (`BlogsEntry`) and web content 
articles (`WebContent`). 

Asset Display Screenlet can also display your custom asset types. See 
[the delegate section of this document](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/asset-display-screenlet-for-ios#delegate) 
for details. 

## Module [](id=module)

- None

## Themes [](id=themes)

- Default

The Default Theme uses different UI elements to show each asset type. For 
example, it displays images with `UIImageView`, and blogs with `UILabel`. 

This Screenlet can also render other Screenlets: 

- Images: Image Display Screenlet
- Videos: Video Display Screenlet
- Audios: Audio Display Screenlet
- PDFs: PDF Display Screenlet
- Blogs entries: Blogs Entry Display Screenlet
- Web content: Web Content Display Screenlet

These Screenlets can also be used alone without Asset Display Screenlet.

## Offline [](id=offline)

This Screenlet supports offline mode so it can function without a network 
connection. For more information on how offline mode works, see the 
[tutorial on its architecture](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/architecture-of-offline-mode-in-liferay-screens). 
Here are the offline mode policies that you can use with this Screenlet: 

| Policy | What happens | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `remote-only` | The Screenlet loads the data from the Liferay instance. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. If the Screenlet successfully loads the data, it stores it in the local cache for later use. | Use this policy when you always need to show updated data, and show nothing when there's no connection. |
| `cache-only` | The Screenlet loads the data from the local cache. If the data isn't there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy when you always need to show local data, without retrieving remote information under any circumstance. |
| `remote-first` | The Screenlet loads the data from the Liferay instance. If this succeeds, the Screenlet shows the data to the user and stores it in the local cache for later use. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet retrieves the data from the local cache. If the data doesn't exist there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy to show the most recent version of the data when connected, but show an outdated version when there's no connection. |
| `cache-first` | The Screenlet loads the data from the local cache. If the data isn't there, the Screenlet requests it from the Liferay instance and notifies the developer about any errors that occur (including connectivity errors). | Use this policy to save bandwidth and loading time in case you have local (but probably outdated) data. |

## Attributes [](id=attributes)

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `assetEntryId` | `number` | The primary key of the asset. | 
| `className` | `string` | The asset's fully qualified class name. For example, a blog entry's `className` is [`com.liferay.blogs.kernel.model.BlogsEntry`](@platform-ref@/7.0-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/blogs/kernel/model/BlogsEntry.html). The `className` and `classPK` attributes are required to instantiate the Screenlet. | 
| `classPK` | `number` | The assetâ€™s unique identifier. The `className` and `classPK` attributes are required to instantiate the Screenlet. |
| `assetEntry` | `Asset` | The `Asset` object to display, selected from a list of assets. Note that if you use this attribute, the Screenlet doesn't need to call the server. |
| `autoLoad` | `boolean` | Whether the asset automatically loads when the Screenlet appears in the app's UI. The default value is `true`. |
| `offlinePolicy` | `string` | The offline mode setting. The default value is `remote-first`. See [the Offline section](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/asset-display-screenlet-for-ios#offline) for details. |

## Delegate [](id=delegate)

Asset Display Screenlet delegates some events to an object that conforms to 
the `AssetDisplayScreenletDelegate` protocol. This protocol lets you implement 
the following methods: 

- `- screenlet:onAssetResponse:`: Called when the Screenlet receives the asset. 

- `- screenlet:onAssetError:`: Called when an error occurs in the process. The 
  `NSError` object describes the error. 
   
- `- screenlet:onConfigureScreenlet:`: Called when the child Screenlet (the 
  Screenlet rendered inside Asset Display Screenlet) has been successfully 
  initialized. Use this method to configure or customize it. The example 
  implementation here sets the child Blogs Entry Display Screenlet's background 
  color to gray: 

        func screenlet(screenlet: AssetDisplayScreenlet, onConfigureScreenlet, 
            childScreenlet: BaseScreenlet?, onAsset asset: Asset) {
                if childScreenlet is BlogsEntryDisplayScreenlet {
                    childScreenlet?.screenletView?.backgroundColor = UIColor.grayColor()
                }
        }

- `- screenlet:onAsset:`: Called to render a custom asset. The following example 
  implementation renders a portal user (`User`). If the asset is a user, this 
  method instantiates a custom `UserProfileView` to render that user: 

        public func screenlet(screenlet: AssetDisplayScreenlet, onAsset asset: Asset) -> UIView? {
            if let type = asset.attributes["object"]?.allKeys.first as? String {
                if type == "user" {
                    let view = NSBundle.mainBundle().loadNibNamed("UserProfileView", owner: self, 
                        options: nil)![0] as? UserProfileView

                    view?.user = User(attributes: asset.attributes)

                    return view
                }
            }
            return nil
        }
