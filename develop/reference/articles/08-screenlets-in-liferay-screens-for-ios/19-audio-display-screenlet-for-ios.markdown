## Features [](id=features)

Audio Display Screenlet displays an audio file from a Liferay instance's 
Documents and Media Library. 

## Module [](id=module)

- None

The Default Theme uses an iOS `AVAudioPlayer` to display the audio player. For 
the player components, this Theme uses `UIButton`, `UISlider`, and several 
`UILabel` instances.

## Offline [](id=offline)

This Screenlet supports offline mode so it can function without a network 
connection. For more information on how offline mode works, see the 
[tutorial on its architecture](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/architecture-of-offline-mode-in-liferay-screens). 
Here are the offline mode policies that you can use with this Screenlet: 

| Policy | What happens | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `remote-only` | The Screenlet loads the data from the Liferay instance. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. If the Screenlet successfully loads the data, it stores it in the local cache for later use. | Use this policy when you always need to show updated data, and show nothing when there's no connection. |
| `cache-only` | The Screenlet loads the data from the local cache. If the data isn't there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy when you always need to show local data, without retrieving remote information under any circumstance. |
| `remote-first` | The Screenlet loads the data from the Liferay instance. If this succeeds, the Screenlet shows the data to the user and stores it in the local cache for later use. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet retrieves the data from the local cache. If the data doesn't exist there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy to show the most recent version of the data when connected, but show an outdated version when there's no connection. |
| `cache-first` | The Screenlet loads the data from the local cache. If the data isn't there, the Screenlet requests it from the Liferay instance and notifies the developer about any errors that occur (including connectivity errors). | Use this policy to save bandwidth and loading time in case you have local (but probably outdated) data. |

## Attributes [](id=attributes)

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `assetEntryId` | `number` | The primary key of the audio file. | 
| `className` | `string` | The audio file's fully qualified class name. Since files in a Documents and Media Library are `DLFileEntry` objects, their `className` is [`com.liferay.document.library.kernel.model.DLFileEntry`](@platform-ref@/7.0-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/model/DLFileEntry.html). The `className` and `classPK` attributes are required to instantiate the Screenlet. |
| `classPK` | `number` | The audio fileâ€™s unique identifier. The `className` and `classPK` attributes are required to instantiate the Screenlet. |
| `autoLoad` | `boolean` | Whether the audio file automatically loads when the Screenlet appears in the app's UI. The default value is `true`. |
| `offlinePolicy` | `string` | The offline mode setting. See [the Offline section](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/audio-display-screenlet-for-ios#offline) for details. |

## Delegate [](id=delegate)

Audio Display Screenlet delegates its events to an object that conforms to the 
`FileDisplayScreenletDelegate` protocol. This protocol lets you implement the 
following methods: 

- `- screenlet:onAssetResponse:`: Called when the Screenlet receives the audio 
  file. 

- `- screenlet:onFileAssetError:`: Called when an error occurs in the process. 
  An `NSError` object describes the error.
