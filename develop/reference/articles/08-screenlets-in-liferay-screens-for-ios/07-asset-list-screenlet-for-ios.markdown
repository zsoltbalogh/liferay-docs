## Features [](id=features)

The Asset List Screenlet can be used to show lists of 
[assets](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/asset-framework) 
from a Liferay instance. For example, you can use the Screenlet to show a 
scrollable collection of assets. It also implements 
[fluent pagination](http://www.iosnomad.com/blog/2014/4/21/fluent-pagination) 
with configurable page size. The Asset List Screenlet can show assets of the 
following classes: 

- `Group`
- `Layout`
- `Organization`
- `User`
- `UserGroup`
- `BlogsEntry`
- `BookmarksEntry`
- `BookmarksFolder`
- `CalendarEvent`
- `DLFileEntry`
- `DLFileEntryMetadata`
- `DLFileEntryType`
- `DLFileRank`
- `DLFileShortcut`
- `DLFileVersion`
- `DDLRecord`
- `DDLRecordSet`
- `JournalArticle` (Web Content)
- `JournalFolder`
- `MBMessage`
- `MBThread`
- `MBCategory`
- `MBDiscussion`
- `MBMailingList`
- `WikiPage`
- `WikiPageResource`
- `WikiNode`

The Asset List Screenlet also supports i18n in asset values.

## Module [](id=module)

- None

## Themes [](id=themes)

- Default

The Default Theme uses a standard `UITableView` to show the scrollable list. 
Other Themes may use a different component, such as `UICollectionView` or 
others, to show the items.

## Offline [](id=offline)

This Screenlet supports offline mode so it can function without a network 
connection. For more information on how offline mode works, see the 
[tutorial on its architecture](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/architecture-of-offline-mode-in-liferay-screens). 
Here are the offline mode policies that you can use with this Screenlet: 

| Policy | What happens | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `remote-only` | The Screenlet loads the list from the portal. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet uses the delegate to notify the developer about the error. If the Screenlet successfully loads the list, it stores the data in the local cache for later use. | Use this policy when you always need to show updated data, and show nothing when there's no connection. |
| `cache-only` | The Screenlet loads the list from the local cache. If the list isn't there, the Screenlet uses the delegate to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy when you always need to show local data, without retrieving remote information under any circumstance. |
| `remote-first` | The Screenlet loads the list from the portal. If this succeeds, the Screenlet shows the list to the user and stores it in the local cache for later use. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet retrieves the list from the local cache. If the list doesn't exist there, the Screenlet uses the delegate to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy to show the most recent version of the data when connected, but show an outdated version when there's no connection. |
| `cache-first` | The Screenlet loads the list from the local cache. If the list isn't there, the Screenlet requests it from the portal and notifies the developer about any errors that occur (including connectivity errors). | Use this policy to save bandwidth and loading time in case you have local (but probably outdated) data. |

## Attributes [](id=attributes)

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `groupId` | `number` | The ID of the site (group) where the asset is stored. If set to `0`, the `groupId` specified in `LiferayServerContext` is used. The default value is `0`. |
| `classNameId` | `number` | The ID of the asset's class name. Use values from the `AssetClassNameId` class or the Liferay Instance's `classname_` database table. |
| `portletItemName` | `string` | The name of the [configuration template](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuration-templates) you used in the Asset Publisher. To use this feature, add an Asset Publisher to one of your site's pages (it may be a hidden page), configure the Asset Publisher's filter (in *Configuration* &rarr; *Setup* &rarr; *Asset Selection*), and then use the Asset Publisher's *Configuration Templates* option to save this configuration with a name. Use this name in this attribute. |
| `offlinePolicy` | `string` | The offline mode setting. The default value is `remote-first`. See the [Offline section](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/assetlistscreenlet-for-ios#offline) for details. |
| `autoLoad` | `boolean` | Whether the list loads automatically when the Screenlet appears in the app's UI. The default value is `true`. |
| `refreshControl` | `boolean` | Defines whether a standard [ios `UIRefreshControl`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIRefreshControl_class/) appears when the user does the pull to refresh gesture. The default value is `true`. |
| `firstPageSize` | `number` | The number of items retrieved from the server for display on the first page. The default value is `50`. |
| `pageSize` | `number` | The number of items retrieved from the server for display on the second and subsequent pages. The default value is `25`. |
| `customEntryQuery` | `Dictionary` | The set of keys (string) and values (string or number) to be used in the [`AssetEntryQuery` object](@platform-ref@/7.0-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/asset/kernel/service/persistence/AssetEntryQuery.html). These values filter the assets returned by the Liferay instance. |

## Methods [](id=methods)

| Method | Return | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `loadList()` | `boolean` | Starts the request to load the list of assets. This list is shown when the response is received. Returns `true` if the request is sent. |

## Delegate [](id=delegate)

The Asset List Screenlet delegates some events to an object that conforms to the 
`AssetListScreenletDelegate` protocol. This protocol lets you implement the 
following methods: 

- `- screenlet:onAssetListResponse:`: Called when a page of assets is 
  received. Note that this method may be called more than once; one call for 
  each page received.

- `- screenlet:onAssetListError:`: Called when an error occurs in the process. 
  The `NSError` object describes the error.

- `- screenlet:onAssetSelected:`: Called when an item in the list is 
  selected.
