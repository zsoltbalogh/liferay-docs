# Starting Module Development [](id=starting-module-development)

Developing modules for @product@ requires:

-   **Creating a folder structure**: A good folder structure facilitates
    evolving and maintaining code, especially in collaboration. Popular tools
    use pre-defined folder structures you're familiar with.

-   **Writing code and configuration files**: A manifest, Java classes, and
    resources. Modules stubbed out with them let you focus on implementing
    logic.

-   **Compilation**:
    [Configuring dependencies](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-dependencies)
    and building the module. Common build tools that manage dependencies include
    Gradle, Maven, and Ant/Ivy.

-   **Deployment**: Interacting with the runtime environment to install,
    monitor, and modify modules.

There are several good build tools for developing modules. This tutorial
demonstrates starting a new module using
[Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-workspace).
It's Liferay's opinionated build environment based on Gradle and bnd that
simplifies module development and automates much of it.

+$$$

**Note**: Liferay lets you develop using your favorite tools. In addition to
providing Liferay Workspace for those who don't already have a preferred build
environment, Liferay provides good support for Maven and Gradle. The following
tutorials and samples demonstrate developing in these environments.

-   [Maven in Liferay @ide@](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-gradle-in-liferay-ide),
    [Maven tutorials](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/maven),
    and [samples](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-sample-projects)

-   [Gradle in Liferay @ide@](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-gradle-in-liferay-ide)
    and [samples](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-sample-projects)

$$$

+$$$

**Note**: Themes and Layout Templates are not built as modules. The
[Themes and Layout Templates tutorials](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/themes-and-layout-templates)
demonstrate creating them. 

$$$

Here are the steps for starting module development:

1. [Set up a Liferay Workspace](#setting-up-a-liferay-workspace)

2. [Create a module](#creating-a-module)

3. [Build and deploy the module](#building-and-deploying-a-module)

On completing this tutorial you'll have created a module and deployed it to a
local @product@ bundle.

## Setting up a Liferay Workspace [](id=setting-up-a-liferay-workspace)

Creating and configuring a Liferay Workspace (Workspace) is straightforward
using a tool called [Blade CLI (Blade)](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/blade-cli).
Blade is a command line tool that creates Workspaces and projects and performs
common tasks.

[Install Blade](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-blade-cli)
if you don't already have it.

The `blade` executable is now in the system path.

You can create a Workspace in the current directory by executing this command:

`blade init [workspaceName]`

You've created a Workspace! Its folder structure looks like the one shown in
the figure below.

![Figure 1: Liferay Workspace aggregates projects so they can leverage the Gradle build environment.](../../images/starting-module-dev-workspace-structure.png)

Workspace can be configured to use a @product@ installation bundle anywhere on
the local file system. The `liferay.workspace.home.dir` property in
`gradle.properties` sets the default bundle location to a folder
`[workspace]/bundles` (not yet created). For convenience it's suggested to
[install a bundle](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/preparing-for-install)
there. If you install it to a different location, uncomment the
`liferay.workspace.home.dir` property and set it to that location.

+$$$

**Note**: User interfaces in Liferay @ide@ let you create and import Liferay
Workspace projects.

To create a project, follow the tutorial [Creating a Liferay Workspace Project with Liferay @ide@](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-a-liferay-workspace-with-liferay-ide).

To import a project, use the wizard from *File &rarr; Import &rarr; Liferay &rarr; Liferay Workspace Project*.

$$$

The Workspace is ready for creating modules.

## Creating a Module [](id=creating-a-module)

Blade provides project *templates* and *sample* projects. The templates stub out
files for different types of modules. The samples can be generated in a
Workspace and demonstrate many module types. Templates and samples help you
create modules fast.

### Using Module Templates [](id=using-module-templates)

The Blade command `blade create -l` lists the project templates.

![Figure 2: Blade's `create` command generates a project based on a template. Executing `create -l` lists the template names.](../../images/starting-module-dev-blade-templates.png)

+$$$

**Note**: [Liferay @ide@'s module wizard](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-modules-with-liferay-ide)
lets you select a module project template. 

$$$

Here's the command syntax for creating a module:

    blade create [options] moduleName

Module templates and their options are described
[here](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/project-templates). 

Here's an example of creating a Liferay MVC Portlet module:

    blade create -t mvc-portlet -p com.liferay.docs.mymodule -c MyMvcPortlet my-module

Module projects are created in the `modules` folder by default.

Here's the module project anatomy:

-   `src/main/java/` &rarr; Java package root

-   `src/main/resources/content/` (optional) &rarr; Language properties root

-   `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/` (optional) &rarr; Root for UI
    templates, such as JSPs

-   `bnd.bnd` &rarr; Specifies essential OSGi module manifest headers

-   `build.gradle` &rarr;
    [Configures dependencies](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-dependencies)
    and more using Gradle

The figure below shows an MVC portlet project.

![Figure 3: Liferay modules use the standard Maven folder structure.](../../images/starting-module-dev-module-structure.png)

Sample modules are another helpful development resource.

### Using Sample Modules [](id=using-module-samples)

An alternative to creating a module from a template is to generate a *sample*
module. Examine them or modify them for your purposes.

This command lists the sample names:

    blade samples

The figure below shows the listing.

![Figure 4: The `blade samples` command lists the sample modules you can create, examine, and modify to meet your needs.](../../images/starting-module-dev-blade-samples.png)

Here's the Blade samples command syntax:

    blade samples [sampleName]

It creates the sample project in a subfolder.

Building a module and deploying it to Liferay is easy.

## Building and Deploying a Module [](id=building-and-deploying-a-module)

Liferay Workspace provides Gradle tasks for building and deploying modules.
Blade's `blade gw` command lets you invoke the Gradle wrapper from any project
folder. You can use `blade gw` just as you would invoke `gradlew`, without
having to specify the wrapper path.

+$$$

**Note**: For an even simpler Gradle wrapper command, install *gw*.

`(sudo) jpm install gw@1.0.1`

Usage: `gw <task>`

$$$

In a module folder, execute this command to list the Gradle tasks available:

    blade gw tasks

Workspace uses bnd to generate the module's OSGi `MANIFEST.MF` file and package
it in the module JAR. To compile the module and generate the module JAR, execute
the `jar` Gradle task:

    blade gw jar

The generated JAR is in the module project's `build/libs` folder and ready for
deployment.

Start your @product@ server, if you haven't already started it.

+$$$

**Tip**: To open a new terminal window and the Workspace's @product@ server
(bundled with Tomcat or JBoss/Wildfly), execute this command:

`blade server start -b`

$$$

Blade deploys modules to the local Liferay server. It communicates with the OSGi
framework using Felix Gogo shell and deploys modules directly to the OSGi
container using Felix File Install commands. The command above uses the default
port `11311`.

<!-- Unless the developer
specifies a Gogo shell port explicitly (e.g., `blade deploy -p <port>`), the
command uses the default port `11311`.-->

<!-- Add the sentence above back when the -p option is re-added. -Cody -->

To deploy the module, execute this command:

	blade deploy

It deploys modules in the current folder tree. For example, executing `blade
deploy` in the `[workspace]/modules` folder deploys all the modules in that
folder and its subfolders.

Liferay @ide@ lets you deploy modules by dragging them from the Package Explorer
onto the Liferay server. @ide@ provides access to
[Liferay Workspace Gradle tasks](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/managing-projects-with-liferay-ide)
too.

![Figure 5: Liferay @ide@ lets you deploy modules using drag-and-drop.](../../images/starting-module-dev-drag-module.png)

+$$$

**Note:** [Blade CLI directly installs modules into the OSGi container](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/deploying-projects-with-blade-cli).
Blade stores the module differently in Liferay than if you were to copy the
module into the `LIFERAY_HOME/deploy` folder. 

$$$

Once you've deployed a portlet module, it's available in the Liferay UI under
the application category and name you specified via the
[portlet component's `com.liferay.portlet.display-category` and `javax.portlet.display-name` properties](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-mvc-portlet#liferay-mvc-portlet-component).

![Figure 6: Here's a bare-bones portlet based on a project template.](../../images/starting-module-dev-portlet.png)

## Redeploying Module Changes Automatically [](id=redeploying-module-changes-automatically)

Blade lets you set a *watch* on changes to a module project's output files. If
they're modified, Blade redeploys the module automatically. To set a watch on a
module at deployment, execute this command in the module project:

	blade deploy -w

Here's output from deploying (and watching) a module named
*com.liferay.docs.mymodule*:

	E:\workspaces\my-liferay-workspace\modules\my-module-project>blade deploy -w

	:modules:my-module-project:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
	:modules:my-module-project:buildCSS UP-TO-DATE
	:modules:my-module-project:processResources UP-TO-DATE
	:modules:my-module-project:transpileJS SKIPPED
	:modules:my-module-project:configJSModules SKIPPED
	:modules:my-module-project:classes UP-TO-DATE
	:modules:my-module-project:jar UP-TO-DATE
	:modules:my-module-project:assemble UP-TO-DATE
	:modules:my-module-project:build

	BUILD SUCCESSFUL

	Total time: 2.962 secs
	install file:/E:/workspaces/my-liferay-workspace/modules/my-module-project/build/libs/com.liferay.docs.mymodule-1.0.0.jar
	Bundle ID: 505
	start 505

	Scanning E:\workspaces\my-liferay-workspace\modules\my-module-project

	...

	Waiting for changes to input files of tasks... (ctrl-d then enter to exit)

The command output indicates that the module is installed and started, reports
the module's OSGi bundle ID, and stands ready to deploy changes to the module.

Congratulations on a great start to developing your module!
