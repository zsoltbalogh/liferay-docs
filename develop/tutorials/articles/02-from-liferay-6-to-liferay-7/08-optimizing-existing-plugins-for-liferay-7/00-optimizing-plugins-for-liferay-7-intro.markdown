# Optimizing Plugins for @product-ver@ [](id=optimizing-plugins-for-liferay-7)

Once you've upgraded your plugin to @product-ver@, you can optimize it to take
advantage of all @product-ver@ offers. Here are some optimizations to consider:

-   Migrating to environments that help you develop and test
    more quickly, such as the
    [Themes Generator](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/migrating-a-6-2-theme-to-liferay-7)
    for themes and
    [Liferay Workspace](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/improved-developer-tooling-liferay-workspace-maven-plugins-and-more#from-the-plugins-sdk-to-liferay-workspace)
    for modules and web applications. 
-   Adapting plugins to [@product-ver@'s modular architecture](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/whats-changed-and-what-hasnt#embracing-a-modular-architecture)
    and updated frameworks, such as Service Builder.
-   Styling your app consistently using Lexicon--Liferay's design
    language standards.
-   Modularizing apps to reap the
    [benefits of modularity](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/osgi-and-modularity-for-liferay-6-developers#modules-as-an-improvement-over-traditional-plugins)
    and all that @product-ver@ offers. 

Several optimization tutorials are here and more are coming soon.
