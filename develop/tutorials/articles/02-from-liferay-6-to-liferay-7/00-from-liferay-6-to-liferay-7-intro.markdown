# From Liferay Portal 6 to 7 [](id=from-liferay-6-to-liferay-7)

Becoming familiar with a platform as large and fully featured as Liferay is 
a big task. You learn the ins and outs of what it can do, the tips and best 
practices of the experts, and you work your way through the APIs. As you do 
this, you become more and more familiar with how things work, become more 
proficient with the platform as you multiply successess on it, and start to 
think in terms of how you'd solve problems most effectively using the tools the 
platform gives you. Eventually, if you use it long enough, it can seem like an 
old friend that's ready to stand by you and help you succeed in your projects. 

And then there's a major upgrade and everything changes. 

This can be disheartening, as what was once familiar now seems alien, and what 
once made you proficient now works differently. But we have good news for you. 
@product-ver@ contains lots of improvements for developers; and this tutorial 
series--or Learning Path--shows you how to make the best of them. You'll also 
learn that yes, while a lot of things have changed, they've changed for the 
better, and yet Liferay still works in ways that you'll find are familiar. In 
other words, since you already know previous versions of Liferay, you're 
several steps ahead of everybody else. 

This Learning Path shows Liferay developers all the architectural improvements 
that @product-ver@ offers. It describes the benefits of @product-ver@ for developers 
compared to previous versions, the changes that modularity brings, how to 
develop modules and how they differ from plugins, and includes comprehensive 
tutorials on how to upgrade existing projects.

You'll be able to apply your existing knowledge of portlet and theme development
and portal customization to @product-ver@ too. To help you upgrade your existing 
plugins, you'll see all the options, learn the pros and cons of each, and 
examine common steps for adapting your plugins to @product-ver@. Finally, you'll 
learn how and when to modularize plugins.

In the end, we believe you'll both want to adopt @product-ver@, and you'll see 
how you can thrive using it.

The first thing to examine is whatâ€™s changed the most since Liferay Portal 6 and
then call out the familiar, good things that remain the same.
