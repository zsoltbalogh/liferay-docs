# OSGi and Modularity for Liferay Portal 6 Developers [](id=osgi-and-modularity-for-liferay-6-developers)

To create a powerful, reliable platform for developing modular applications,
Liferay sought best-of-breed standards-based frameworks and technologies.
It was imperative not only to meet demands for enterprise digital experiences
but also to offer developers, both experienced with Liferay and new to Liferay,
a clear and elegant way to create apps.

Here were some of the key goals:

- Allow breaking down a large system into smaller pieces of code, whose
boundaries and relationships could be clearly defined.

- Explicitly differentiate public APIs from private APIs.

- Facilitate extensibility of existing code.

- Modernize the development environment, leveraging more state-of-the-art tools
to provide a great developer experience.

It wasn't long before Liferay discovered that OSGi and its supporting
tools/technologies fit the bill!

Before setting up your tools and upgrading your plugins, you'll learn how
@product-ver@ uses OSGi to meet the objectives listed above. And equally
important, you'll discover how easy and fun modular development can be.
