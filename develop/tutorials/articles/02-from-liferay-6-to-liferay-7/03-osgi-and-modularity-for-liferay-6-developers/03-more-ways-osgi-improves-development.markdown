# More Ways OSGi Improves Development on Liferay [](id=more-ways-osgi-improves-development-on-liferay)

Here are more ways OSGi meets the
[developer experience goals](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/osgi-and-modularity-for-liferay-6-developers)
mentioned earlier. These topics apply to both new and veteran Liferay
developers, so you should become familiar with them. After reading each one,
make sure to COME BACK HERE to continue with the next tutorial listed or, when
you've finished reading all of them, continue this Learning Path.
 
1.  [Leveraging Dependencies](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/leveraging-dependencies):
    In @product-ver@, you can both declare dependencies among modules and
    combine modules to create applications. Since leveraging dependencies
    provides huge benefits, there's an entire tutorial for it.

2.  [OSGi Services and Dependency Injection](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/osgi-services-and-dependency-injection-with-declarative-services):
    OSGi includes a powerful concept called OSGi Services (also known as
    microservices). OSGi's Declarative Services standard provides a clean way to
    inject dependencies in a dynamic environment. It's similar to Spring DI,
    except the changes happen while the system is running. It also offers an
    elegant extensibility model that @product-ver@ leverages extensively.

3.  [Dynamic Deployment](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/dynamic-deployment):
    Module deployment is managed by @product-ver@ (not the application server).
    This section demonstrates how to use dynamic deployment for better control
    and efficiency.

Liferay's developer tooling for @product-ver@ compliments module development. It
supports traditional plugin development and facilitates moving applications to
modules. There are improvements for developing themes and using Maven and Gradle
build systems, and there's even a code upgrade tool that adapts existing code to
@product-ver@'s API and automates much of the plugin upgrade process. Developer
tooling improvements are next.
