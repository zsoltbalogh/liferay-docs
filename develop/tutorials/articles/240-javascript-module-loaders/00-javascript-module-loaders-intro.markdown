# JavaScript Module Loaders [](id=javascript-module-loaders)

JavaScript modules encapsulate code into useful units that export their
functions. Structuring an application this way makes it easier to work with in
these ways: 

- Other modules can explicitly require this piece of code. 
- Structuring an application this way makes it easier to see the broader
  scope. 
- Modular applications keep related functionality close together. 
- Modularized code makes it easier to find what you're looking for.

This section contains tutorials relating to the different JavaScript Module
Loaders included present on the Liferay platform.
