# Export/Import and Staging [](id=export-import-and-staging)

The Export/Import and Staging features give users the power to plan page
publication and manage content. The Export/Import feature lets users export
content from the portal and import external content into the portal. Providing
the export feature in your application gives users the flexibility of exporting
content they've created in your application to other places, such as another
portal instance, or to save the content for a later use. Import does the
opposite: it brings the data from a LAR file into your portal.

For instance, suppose you're managing an online education course. Because of the
nature of an online course, the site's data (grades, assignments, etc.) is
purged every semester to make way for new incoming students. In a scenario like
this, there is a need to frequently store a complete record of all data given
during a course. The institution offering the course must keep records of the
course's data for a minimum number of years. To abide by these requirements,
having a gradebook application with an export/import feature would let you clear
the application's data for a new semester, but save the previous class's work.
You could export the students' grades as a LAR file and save it outside the
course's site. If the grades ever needed to be accessed again, you could import
the LAR and view the student records.

The Export/Import feature adds another dimension to your application by
letting you produce reusable content and import content from other places. To
learn more about using the Export/Import feature, visit the
[Exporting/Importing App Data](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/exporting-importing-widget-data)
User Guide section.

Staging lets you change your site behind the scenes without affecting the live
site, and then you can publish all the changes in one fell swoop. Keep in mind
that Staging leverages the Export/Import framework, which is an essential part
of the publishing process. If you include staging support in your application,
your users can stage its content until it's ready.

For example, if you have an application that provides information intended only
during a specific holiday, supporting the Staging environment lets users save
your application's assets specific for that holiday. They'll reside
in the Staging environment until they're ready for publishing. To learn more
about Staging, visit the
[Staging Content for Publication](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/staging-content-for-publication)
section.

Besides configuring these features for your application, you can also access
APIs that let you write custom code, extending Liferay's default functionality.

In this section of tutorials, you'll learn how to implement
Staging and the Export/Import framework. The main areas of Staging code to focus
on are outlined below:

1.  [StagedModel](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/model/StagedModel.html):
    The `StagedModel` is the cornerstone of Staging. All content that must be
    handled in Staging should implement this interface; it provides the behavior
    contract for the entities Staging uses during the Staging process.

2.  [StagedModelDataHandler](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/exportimport/kernel/lar/StagedModelDataHandler.html):
    These data handlers are responsible for handling one specific entity class.
    For example, the `BookmarksEntryStagedModelDataHandler` handles the
    `BookmarksEntry` during Staging: exporting data, serializing content,
    finding existing entries, etc.

3.  [PortletDataHandler](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/exportimport/kernel/lar/PortletDataHandler.html):
    These data handlers are responsible for handling aspects of the portlet's
    configuration and publication during Staging.

4.  [ExportActionableDynamicQuery](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/dao/orm/ExportActionableDynamicQuery.html):
    This framework is useful when developing Staging support. Its purpose is to
    query data from the database and process it during publication. It's
    automatically generated if your entity contains the right fields so there's
    no need to worry about configuring it.

5.  [ExportImportContentProcessor](@app-ref@/web-experience/latest/javadocs/com/liferay/exportimport/content/processor/ExportImportContentProcessor.html)
    and
    [ExportImportPortletPreferencesProcessor](@app-ref@/web-experience/latest/javadocs/com/liferay/exportimport/portlet/preferences/processor/ExportImportPortletPreferencesProcessor.html):
    Advanced frameworks only needed in special cases. The
    `ExportImportContentProcessor` lets you process your content during a
    publication process. The `ExportImportPortletPreferencesProcessor` lets you
    process your portlet preferences (application's configuration) during a
    publication process.
