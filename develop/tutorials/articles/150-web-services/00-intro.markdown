# Web Services [](id=web-services)

Generating and invoking web services is a central part of the Liferay 
development experience. After all, what good is it if you can't generate remote 
services for an app you're developing, or call Liferay's built-in remote 
services? It's no good at all! Liferay without web services would be like a 
luxury car without wheels. Fortunately, Liferay comes with full set of JSON and 
SOAP web services that you can invoke until your heart's content. Liferay also 
provides Service Builder to generate local and remote services for your apps. 

The tutorials that follow show you how to work with web services in Liferay. 
You'll learn how to use Service Builder to generate remote services for your 
apps. You'll also learn how to invoke those services, and any other Liferay web 
services.
