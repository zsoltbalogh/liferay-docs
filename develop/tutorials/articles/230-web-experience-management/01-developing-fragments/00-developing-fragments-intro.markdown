# Developing Page Fragments [](id=developing-fragments)

The goal of Page Fragments is to take a mock-up design and realize it on a web 
page as accurately as possible. To do this, developers are given a space where 
they have a "blank slate."  You have three tools at your disposal to accomplish 
this:

**HTML**: The markup of the fragment. Fragments use standard HTML with 
   special tags to add dynamic behavior.

**CSS**: CSS styles and positions the fragment's markup. 

**JavaScript**: JavaScript provides dynamic behavior to the fragment.

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all completely standard, just like anywhere
else on the web, but are also enhanced with Liferay-specific features. You can
specify text and images as editable, as well as providing for "rich text": that
is, text with additional formatting. Liferay portlets can also be embedded in
Fragments as "widgets," making pages with Fragments more dynamic than regular
web content.
