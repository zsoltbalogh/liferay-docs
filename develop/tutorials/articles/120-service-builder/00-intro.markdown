# Service Builder [](id=service-builder)

An application without reliable business logic or persistence isn't much of an 
application at all. Unfortunately, writing your own persistence code often takes 
a great deal of time. Fortunately, Liferay provides the Liferay Service Builder 
to generate it for you. You might now be thinking, "What?! I hate code 
generators!" Not to fear; you can still write your own persistence code if you 
wish. And if you choose to use Service Builder, you can edit and customize the 
code it generates. Regardless of how you produce your persistence code, you can 
then use it to implement your app's business logic. 

This section of tutorials shows you how to use Service Builder to generate your 
persistence framework and implement your business logic. You're also shown how 
to use Spring in your app.
