# Application Security [](id=application-security)

Liferay's development framework provides an application security platform that's
got years of experience behind it. You don't need to roll your own security for
your applications. Instead, you can specify security for your applications using
Liferay's framework. 

Beyond security for applications, there are many ways to extend the default
security model by customizing the authentication process. This group of
tutorials teaches you about them: 

- Resources, Roles, and Permissions
- Custom SSO Providers 
- Authentication Pipelines 
- Service Access Policies 
- Authentication Verifiers
