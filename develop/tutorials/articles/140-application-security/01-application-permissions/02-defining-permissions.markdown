# Defining Resources and Permissions [](id=defining-resources-and-permissions)

Your first step in implementing permissions is to define the resources and the
permissions that protect them. There are two different kinds of resources:
*portlet resources* and *model resources*. 

Portlet resources represent portlets. The names of portlet resources are the
portlet IDs from the portlets' `@Component` properties or if you're using a WAR
file, `portlet.xml` files. Model resources refer to model objects, usually
persisted as entities to a database. The names of model resources are their
fully qualified class names. In the XML displayed below, permission
implementations are first defined for the *portlet* resource and then for the
*model* resources.

Model resources represent models, such as blog entries. Resources are named
using the fully qualified class names of the entities they represent.

**Note:** For each resource, there are four scopes to which the permissions can
be applied: company, group, group-template, or individual. Because these are
called *portlet resources* here and in the code, this can be confusing. The
other scopes are mostly used internally for various Liferay constructs (such as
Sites or Categories).

You define resources and their permissions using an XML file. By convention,
this file is called `default.xml` and exists in a module's
`src/main/resources/resource-actions` folder. 

Because of the two different types of resources, you'll have two of these files:
one in your portlet module to define the portlet resources and one in your
service module to define the model resources. 

## Defining Portlet Resource Permissions [](id=defining-portlet-resource-permissions)

Define the portlet resources first; here's an example using Liferay's Blogs
application. 

1.  Start with the DTD declaration: 

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE resource-action-mapping PUBLIC "-//Liferay//DTD Resource Action Mapping 7.1.0//EN" "http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-resource-action-mapping_7_0_0.dtd">

2.  The root tag contains all the resources to be declared: 

        <resource-action-mapping>

        </resource-action-mapping> 

3.  Inside these tags, define your resources. The Blogs application defines two
    portlet resources: 

        <portlet-resource>
            <portlet-name>com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsAdminPortlet</portlet-name>
            <permissions>
                <supports>
                    <action-key>ACCESS_IN_CONTROL_PANEL</action-key>
                    <action-key>CONFIGURATION</action-key>
                    <action-key>VIEW</action-key>
                </supports>
                <site-member-defaults>
                    <action-key>VIEW</action-key>
                </site-member-defaults>
                <guest-defaults>
                    <action-key>VIEW</action-key>
                </guest-defaults>
                <guest-unsupported>
                    <action-key>ACCESS_IN_CONTROL_PANEL</action-key>
                    <action-key>CONFIGURATION</action-key>
                </guest-unsupported>
            </permissions>
        </portlet-resource>
        <portlet-resource>
            <portlet-name>com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet</portlet-name>
            <permissions>
                <supports>
                    <action-key>ADD_PORTLET_DISPLAY_TEMPLATE</action-key>
                    <action-key>ADD_TO_PAGE</action-key>
                    <action-key>CONFIGURATION</action-key>
                    <action-key>VIEW</action-key>
                </supports>
                <site-member-defaults>
                    <action-key>VIEW</action-key>
                </site-member-defaults>
                <guest-defaults>
                    <action-key>VIEW</action-key>
                </guest-defaults>
                <guest-unsupported>
                    <action-key>ADD_PORTLET_DISPLAY_TEMPLATE</action-key>
                    <action-key>CONFIGURATION</action-key>
                </guest-unsupported>
            </permissions>
        </portlet-resource>

The Blogs application comprises two portlets: the Blogs portlet itself and
the Blogs Admin portlet that appears in the Site menu for administrators.
Define your portlets by their names, and then list the permissions for the
portlet. The Blogs portlet, for example, supports four permissions:
ADD_PORTLET_DISPLAY_TEMPLATE, ADD_TO_PAGE, CONFIGURATION, and VIEW. The Blogs
Admin portlet has an additional permission: ACCESS_IN_CONTROL_PANEL, which
defines who can see the entry in the Site menu. 

Once you've defined permissions at the portlet level, you can set default
permissions for different types of users. The DTD allows for site member and
guest defaults. Since guests are users that aren't logged in, there's also
a `guest-unsupported` tag for defining permissions guests can *never* have (in
other words, the user must be logged in and identifiable). 

That's all there is to it! Your next task is to define permissions for your
model resources. 

## Defining Model Resource Permissions [](id=defining-model-resource-permissions)

Defining permissions for models is a similar process. Create a `default.xml`
file in your service module's `src/main/resources/resource-actions` folder. In
this file, you must define top-level function permissions and individual entity
permissions using the same `<model-resource>` tag. 

This can be confusing, so some explanation is in order. Model permissions for
what Liferay calls the *root model* are defined separately from permissions on
stored entities, which Liferay calls the *model*. This makes sense when you
think about the functions users can perform: 

- Creating something new 
- Editing something that exists

Creating something new (like adding a new Blog entry) is different from
accessing something that exists. A Blog owner should be able to create or edit
a Blog entry, but a User or guest should have read permission for existing
entries and no permission to create them. 

Permission to create something new that doesn't yet exist is a *root model*
permission, whether that functionality is exposed in a portlet or not.
Permission on an existing resource is a *model* permission. 

Now you're ready to define both your root model and model permissions. 

1.  First, create the skeleton for your file: 

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE resource-action-mapping PUBLIC "-//Liferay//DTD Resource Action Mapping 7.1.0//EN" "http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-resource-action-mapping_7_0_0.dtd">

        <resource-action-mapping>

        </resource-action-mapping> 

2.  Inside the `<resource-action-mapping>` tags, use a `<model-resource>` tag to
    define permissions for the root model:

        <model-resource>
            <model-name>com.liferay.blogs</model-name>
            <portlet-ref>
                <portlet-name>com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsAdminPortlet</portlet-name>
                <portlet-name>com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet</portlet-name>
            </portlet-ref>
            <root>true</root>
            <weight>1</weight>
            <permissions>
                <supports>
                    <action-key>ADD_ENTRY</action-key>
                    <action-key>PERMISSIONS</action-key>
                    <action-key>SUBSCRIBE</action-key>
                </supports>
                <site-member-defaults>
                    <action-key>SUBSCRIBE</action-key>
                </site-member-defaults>
                <guest-defaults />
                <guest-unsupported>
                    <action-key>ADD_ENTRY</action-key>
                    <action-key>PERMISSIONS</action-key>
                    <action-key>SUBSCRIBE</action-key>
                </guest-unsupported>
            </permissions>
        </model-resource>

    The model name (`com.liferay.blogs`) is just a package name. The
    `<root>true</root>` tag defines this as a root model. The `<weight>` tag
    defines the order of these permissions in the GUI. The permissions defined
    are ADD_ENTRY (add a Blog entry), PERMISSIONS (set permissions on Blog
    entries), and SUBSCRIBE (receive notifications when Blog entries are
    created). These are all root model permissions, because no primary key in
    the database can be assigned to any of these functions. 

3.  Finally, define your model permissions: 

        <model-resource>
            <model-name>com.liferay.blogs.model.BlogsEntry</model-name>
            <portlet-ref>
                <portlet-name>com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsAdminPortlet</portlet-name>
                <portlet-name>com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet</portlet-name>
            </portlet-ref>
            <weight>2</weight>
            <permissions>
                <supports>
                    <action-key>ADD_DISCUSSION</action-key>
                    <action-key>DELETE</action-key>
                    <action-key>DELETE_DISCUSSION</action-key>
                    <action-key>PERMISSIONS</action-key>
                    <action-key>UPDATE</action-key>
                    <action-key>UPDATE_DISCUSSION</action-key>
                    <action-key>VIEW</action-key>
                </supports>
                <site-member-defaults>
                    <action-key>ADD_DISCUSSION</action-key>
                    <action-key>VIEW</action-key>
                </site-member-defaults>
                <guest-defaults>
                    <action-key>ADD_DISCUSSION</action-key>
                    <action-key>VIEW</action-key>
                </guest-defaults>
                <guest-unsupported>
                    <action-key>DELETE</action-key>
                    <action-key>DELETE_DISCUSSION</action-key>
                    <action-key>PERMISSIONS</action-key>
                    <action-key>UPDATE</action-key>
                    <action-key>UPDATE_DISCUSSION</action-key>
                </guest-unsupported>
            </permissions>
        </model-resource>

    Note the lack of a `<root>` tag, the fully qualified class name for the
    model, and the permissions that operate on an entity with a primary key. 

## Enabling Your Permissions Configuration [](id=enabling-your-permissions-configuration)

Your last step is to enable your permission definitions. Each module that
contains a `default.xml` permissions definition file must also have
a `portlet.properties` file with a property that defines where to find the
permissions definition file. For your service and your web modules, create
a `portlet.properties` file in `src/main/resources` and make sure it has this
property: 

    resource.actions.configs=resource-actions/default.xml

Once you've defined portlet permissions, root model permissions, and model
permissions, you've completed step 1 (the *D* in DRAC). Congratulations! You're
now ready to *register* the resources you've now defined in the permissions
system.
