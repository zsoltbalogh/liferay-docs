# Authentication Pipelines [](id=authentication-pipelines)

The authentication process is a pipeline through which users can be validated by
one or several systems. As a developer, you can authenticate users to anything
you wish, rather than be limited by what @product@ supports out of the box. 

Here's how authentication works under most circumstances: 

1.  Users provide their credentials to the Login Portlet to begin an
    authenticated session in a browser. 

2.  Alternatively, credentials are provided to @product@'s API endpoints, where
    they are sent in an HTTP BASIC Auth header. 

3.  Alternatively, credentials can be provided by another system. These are
    managed by `AutoLogin` components. 

4.  Credentials are checked by default against the database, but they can be
    delegated to other systems instead of or in addition to it. This is called
    an *Authentication Pipeline*. You can add `Authenticator`s to the pipeline 
    to support any system. 

5.  You can also customize the Login Portlet to support whatever user interface
    any of these systems need. This gives you full flexibility over the entire
    authentication process. 

This structure lets you support an authentication mechanism and/or accept
credentials from a system that @product@ doesn't yet support. If you don't like
the user interface for signing in, you can replace it with your own. 

These tutorials guide you through these customizations. You'll discover three
kinds of customizations: 

- **Auto Login:** the easiest of the three, this lets you authenticate to @product@ 
  using credentials provided in the HTTP header from another system. 

- **Authentication Pipelines:** if you need to check credentials against other
  systems instead of or in addition to @product@'s database, you can create a
  pipeline. 

- **Custom Login Portlet:** if you want to change the user's sign-in experience
  completely, you can implement your own Login portlet. 

Read on to discover how to customize your users' sign-in experience.
