# Maven [](id=maven)

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a viable option for managing Liferay
projects if you don't want to use Liferay's default Gradle management system.
Liferay provides several
[Maven plugins](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/maven) to let you
generate and manage your project. Liferay also provides Maven artifacts that are
easy to obtain and are required for Liferay Maven module development. In the
Maven tutorials, you'll learn how to

- Install Liferay Maven artifacts.
- Generate Liferay projects using Maven archetypes.
- Create a Module JAR using Maven.
- Deploy a project built with Maven to @product@.
- Create a remote repository for Maven projects.
- Deploy a Maven project to a remote repository.
- Use Service Builder in a Maven project.
- Compile Sass files in a Maven project.
- Build a Liferay theme in a Maven project.

Because @product@ is tool agnostic, Maven is fully supported for @product@
development. Read on to learn more!
