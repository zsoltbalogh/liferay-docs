# Installing Liferay Workspace [](id=installing-liferay-workspace)

You can install Liferay Workspace using the Liferay Project SDK installer. This
installs JPM and
[Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/blade-cli) into your user
home folder and optionally initializes a Liferay Workspace folder. This is the
same installer used to install Blade CLI, which is covered in the
[Installing Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-blade-cli)
tutorial.

Follow the steps below to download and install Liferay Workspace:

1.  Download the
    [Liferay Project SDK installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20IDE/3.2.0%20M1/).
    The Project SDK installer is currently listed under *Liferay IDE*, so select
    the latest IDE version for the latest Project SDK installer. You can select
    an installer that includes @ide@, depending on your needs. Do **not**
    select the large green download button; this downloads Liferay Portal
    instead.

2.  Run the installer. Click *Next* to step through the installer's
    introduction.

3.  Set the directory where your Liferay Workspace should be initialized.

    Then click *Next*.

4.  Choose the Liferay product type you intend to use with the workspace. Then
    click *Next*.

    **Note:** You'll be prompted for your liferay.com username and password
    before downloading the Liferay DXP bundle. Your credentials are not saved
    locally; they're saved as a token in the `~/.liferay` folder. The token is
    used by your workspace if you ever decide to redownload a DXP bundle.
    Furthermore, the bundle that is downloaded in your workspace is also copied
    to your `~/.liferay/bundles` folder, so if you decide to initialize another
    @product@ instance of the same version, the bundle is not re-downloaded. See
    the
    [Adding a Liferay Bundle to a Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-a-liferay-workspace#adding-a-liferay-bundle-to-a-workspace)
    for more information on this topic.

That's it! Liferay Workspace is now installed on your machine!
