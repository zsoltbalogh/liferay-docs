# Liferay Workspace [](id=liferay-workspace)

A *Liferay Workspace* is a generated environment that is built to hold and
manage your Liferay projects. This workspace is intended to aid in the
management of Liferay projects by providing various Gradle build scripts and
configured properties. This is the official way to create @product-ver@ modules
using Gradle. For those developers that still want to develop WAR-style plugins
using the Plugins SDK, this way is also supported using a Liferay Workspace.

Liferay Workspaces can be used in many different development environments, which
makes it flexible and applicable to many different developers. For example, a
Liferay Workspace easily integrates with Liferay IDE, providing a seamless
development experience. To learn more about Liferay IDE and using workspace with
it, see the
[Creating a Liferay Workspace with Liferay IDE](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace-with-liferay-ide)
tutorial.

Your workspace also offers Gradle properties that you can modify to help manage
the generated folders. There are also some folders that aren't generated by
default, but can be manually created and set. This provides you the power to
customize your workspace's folder structure any way you'd like. To learn more
info on a workspace's folder structure and how you can configure a workspace,
see the
[Configuring a Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-a-liferay-workspace)
tutorial.

Liferay Workspaces offer a full development lifecycle for your modules to make
your Liferay development easier than ever. The development lifecycle includes
creating, building, deploying, testing, and releasing modules. To learn more
about the development lifecycle of a Liferay Workspace, see the
[Development Lifecycle for a Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/development-lifecycle-for-a-liferay-workspace)
tutorial.
