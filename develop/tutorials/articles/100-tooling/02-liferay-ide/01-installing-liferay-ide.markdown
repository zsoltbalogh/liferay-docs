**Note:** This tutorial is targeted for developers who are interested in
installing the latest 3.2.0 IDE (Dev Studio) milestone. If you're interested in

tutorial.

Liferay @ide@ is a plugin for Eclipse that brings many Liferay-specific features
to the table. You can install it into your existing Eclipse environment, or
Liferay provides a bundled version included in its Project SDK. In this
tutorial, you'll learn the different methods available for installing Dev
Studio.

**Important:** If you're installing Dev Studio into an existing Eclipse
environment, you must be on Eclipse Oxygen or newer. For instructions on
upgrading to Oxygen, see Eclipse's
[upgrade documentation](https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_upgrade_Eclipse_IDE%3F#Upgrading_existing_Eclipse_IDE_and_Installed_Features_to_newer_release).
With this particular upgrade, you should also deactivate the current available
update sites in the *Window* &rarr; *Preferences* &rarr; *Install/Update* &rarr;
*Available Software Sites* menu to ensure a successful upgrade (e.g., Neon).

## Install the Dev Studio Bundle [](id=install-the-liferay-ide-bundle)

1.  Download and install [Java](http://java.oracle.com). Liferay runs on Java,
    so you'll need it to run everything else. Because you'll be developing apps
    for Liferay Portal in Dev Studio, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is
    required. It is an enhanced version of the Java Environment used for
    developing new Java technology. You can download the Java SE JDK from the
    Java
    [Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    page. 

2.  Download Liferay's
    [Project SDK with @ide@](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20IDE/3.2.0%20M1/)
    executable that correlates to your operating system. The Project SDK
    includes @ide@,
    [Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-workspace),
    and [Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/blade-cli).

3.  Run the Project SDK executable and step through the installer to install
    everything to your machine. For help with setting up proxy settings (if
    necessary), see the
    [Liferay IDE Proxy Settings](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/setting-proxy-requirements-for-liferay-ide)
    and
    [Liferay Workspace Proxy Settings](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/setting-proxy-requirements-for-liferay-workspace)
    tutorials for more information.

Congratulations! You've installed Liferay @ide@! It's now available in the
Project SDK folder's `liferay-developer-studio`. To run Dev Studio, execute the
`DeveloperStudio` executable. A Liferay Workspace has also been initialized in
that same folder.

Congratulations! You've installed Liferay Dev Studio!
