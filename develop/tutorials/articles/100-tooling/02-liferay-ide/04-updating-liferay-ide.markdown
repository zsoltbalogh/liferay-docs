# Updating Liferay Dev Studio [](id=updating-liferay-ide)

If you're already using Liferay Dev Studio but need to update your environment,
follow the steps below:

1.  In Dev Studio, go to *Help* &rarr; *Install New Software...*. 

2.  In the *Work with* field, copy in the URL
    http://releases.liferay.com/tools/ide/latest/milestone/. Since Dev Studio
    3.2.0 is only in the milestone phase, the typical
    http://releases.liferay.com/tools/ide/latest/stable/ URL will not be
    relevant until the first GA is released.

    <!-- TODO: Update above URL once 3.2.0 GA is released. -Cody -->

3.  You'll see the Dev Studio components in the list below. Check them off and click
    *Next*.

4.  Accept the terms of the agreements. Click *Next*, and Dev Studio is updated.
    You must restart Dev Studio for the updates to take effect.

You're now on the latest version of Liferay Dev Studio!
