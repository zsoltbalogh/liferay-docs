# Forms [](id=forms)

Forms are a must-have tool in any developer's UI bag. Rather than write
your HTML from scratch, Liferay provides you with taglibs that offer
everything standard HTML elements have, as well as some additional attributes
that are Liferay specific. For a full list of all the available taglibs and
attributes, look at Liferay's API docs on [docs.liferay.com](@platform-ref@/7.0-latest/taglibs/util-taglib)

Using a combination of Liferay's `AUI` taglibs and [Lexicon](http://liferay.github.io/lexicon/)
classes, you can create forms in your app's JSPs. You can learn how to create
an MVC portlet project in the [using-the-mvc-portlet-template](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-the-mvc-portlet-template) tutorial.

In this section of tutorials, you'll learn how to use the platform features
to create forms with ease.
