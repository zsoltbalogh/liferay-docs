# Collaboration [](id=collaboration)

The collaboration suite helps users interact and create content together. This
can be as simple as a quick conversation in the Message Boards app or as complex
as joint file management via the Documents and Media Library. Users can Blog
their experiences and share knowledge with the Wiki. Comments can be posted on
all content. Integrated applications mean the whole is greater than the sum of
the parts: together, users create something of value that couldn't exist if they
were working in isolation. 

Underlying the collaboration suite is a set of powerful APIs so you can leverage
these features in your own apps. For example, if your app lets users create
a custom content type, you can tie into the collaboration suite's social API to
let users comment on and rate that content. You can also customize how your
app's users select items from the Documents and Media Library, send custom
alerts and announcements, and much, much more. The tutorials in this section
show you how.
