# Adaptive Media [](id=adaptive-media)

The Adaptive Media app on 
[Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace) 
lets administrators tailor the quality of images to the device viewing those
images. For information on using this app, see 
[the Adaptive Media user guide](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/adapting-your-media-across-multiple-devices). 

If you want to leverage Adaptive Media in your own app, you're in the right
place! The tutorials here explain how to use adapted images in your app. You'll
also learn how to change Adaptive Media's image processing. 

Onwards!
