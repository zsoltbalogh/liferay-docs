# Social API [](id=social-api)

The social API lets users interact with content throughout the portal, including
content in your applications. For example, users can provide feedback on
content, share that content with others, subscribe to receive notifications, and
more. These features let users stay up to date on the latest and greatest that
you have to share. 

The tutorials that follow show you how to take advantage of this social API to 
enable these features in your own app.
