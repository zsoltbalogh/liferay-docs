# Item Selector [](id=item-selector)

An *Item Selector* is a UI component for selecting entities in a user-friendly
manner. Many Liferay apps use Item Selectors to let users select items such as
images, videos, audio files, documents, and pages. For example, the Documents
and Media Library lets users select files.

The Item Selector API provides a framework for you to use, extend, and create 
Item Selectors in your own apps. The tutorials in this section show you how to 
use this framework. 

Here are some use cases for the Item Selector API: 

1.  Letting your app's users select entities via an Item Selector. 

2.  Configuring an Item Selector to select your app's custom entity. 

3.  Customizing the selection experience by adding a new *selection view* for an 
    entity. 

You'll learn what a selection view is, along with the Item Selector API's other 
components, in the next tutorial.
