# Liferay Soy Portlet [](id=liferay-soy-portlet)

A Soy portlet is an extension of Liferay's MVC portlet framework. This gives you
access to all the MVC Portlet functionality you are familiar with, plus the
added bonus of using Soy templates for writing your front-end. Soy templates use 
an easy templating language that also lets you use MetalJS components. With
all these benefits and more, Soy portlets can be a good front-end tool to have
in your utility belt.

You can learn about Liferay MVC portlets in the [Creating an MVC Portlet](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-an-mvc-portlet)
tutorial.

This section covers how to implement a Soy portlet.
