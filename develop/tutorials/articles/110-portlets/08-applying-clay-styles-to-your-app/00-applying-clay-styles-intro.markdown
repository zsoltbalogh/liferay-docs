# Applying Clay Styles to your App [](id=applying-clay-styles-to-your-app)

It's important to have a consistent user experience across your apps. 
Portal's built-in apps achieve this through Liferay's 
[Lexicon Experience Language](https://lexicondesign.io/) and its web 
implementation, 
[Clay](https://clayui.com/docs/getting_started/clay.html). 

Clay provides a consistent, user-friendly UI and is 
included in all themes that are based on the `_styled` base theme, making all 
the components documented on the 
[Clay site](https://clayui.com/docs/components/alerts.html) 
accessible.

This means you can use Clay markup and components in your apps. These tutorials 
explain how to apply Clay's design patterns to achieve the same look and feel as 
Portal's built-in apps. 

The tutorials in this section cover the following topics:

- Applying Clay to navigation
- Implementing the Management Toolbar
