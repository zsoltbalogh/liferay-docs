# Using npm in Your Portlets [](id=introduction)

Since Liferay DXP Fix Pack 30 and Liferay Portal 7.0 CE GA5, you can use 
npm as your JavaScript package manager tool--including npm and npm
packages--while developing portlets in your normal, everyday workflow.
 
Deployed portlets leverage [Liferay AMD Loader](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-amd-module-loader) 
to share JavaScript modules and take advantage of semantic versioning 
when resolving modules among portlets on the same page.

This section of tutorials covers how to set up npm-based portlet projects and 
how @product@ supports them.
