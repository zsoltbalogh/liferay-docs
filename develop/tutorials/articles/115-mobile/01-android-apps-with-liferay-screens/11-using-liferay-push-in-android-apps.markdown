# Using Liferay Push in Android Apps [](id=using-liferay-push-in-android-apps)

Liferay Screens supports push notifications in Android apps. To use
them, you must configure some APIs and modify your app to consume and/or
produce push notifications. This tutorial shows how to do all these things.

## Configuring to Use Liferay Push Notifications [](id=configuring-to-use-liferay-push-notifications)

Your first step is to create and configure a Google project to use Google Cloud
Messaging ([GCM](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/)). You also need
to configure the Liferay Push app to use the project's GCM API. 

Follow these steps to create and configure a Google project to support cloud
messaging: 

1. On the 
   [Google Cloud Messaging page](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/start/), 
   create a configuration file by clicking *Get a Configuration File*. On the 
   screen that appears, set your *App name* and *Android package name*, and then 
   click *Continue To Choose and Configure Services*. On the next screen, click 
   *Enable Google Cloud Messaging*. 

2. Copy and save the *Server API Key* and *Sender ID* values you're presented 
   with. You'll need to use these values later as the push notifications API 
   keys for Liferay Push. 

       ![Figure 1: You need the Server API Key and Sender ID to enable Liferay Push.](../../../images/screens-android-push-project-and-server-key.png)

Now that you've set up your Google project, you can configure the Liferay Push 
app to use the project's GCM API. Install the Liferay Push app from the 
[Liferay Marketplace](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace). 
In the your Liferay instance's Control Panel, navigate to the app by selecting 
*Configuration* &rarr; *Push Notifications*. Then select the 
*Configuration* &rarr; *Android* tab. Set the push notifications *API Key* to 
the value of the Server API Key you generated in your Google project. You can 
also set the number of retries in the event that sending a notification fails. 

Great! Your Liferay instance is now ready to send push notifications to your 
Android apps!

## Receiving and Sending Push Notifications [](id=receiving-and-sending-push-notifications)

The 
[Liferay Push Client for Android](https://github.com/brunofarache/liferay-push-android) 
streamlines registering a device with the portal for receiving and sending push
notifications. 

The steps for using the client are explained in detail 
[here](https://github.com/brunofarache/liferay-push-android), 
but the main steps are demonstrated here.

In your Android application's Gradle build file, 
[add a new dependency](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-dependencies) 
on the Liferay Push Client for Android: 

	dependencies {

		...

		compile 'com.liferay.mobile:liferay-push:1.0.7'
	}

Make sure your app's `liferay-plugin-package.properties` file specifies the Push
Notifications portlet as a required deployment context: 

    required-deployment-contexts=\
        push-notifications-portlet\
        ...

Next, you can learn how to register listeners for push notifications. 

### Receiving Push Notifications [](id=receiving-push-notifications)

First, register your device in GCM with the `SENDER_ID` you generated
previously:

	Session session = new SessionImpl(YOUR_SERVER, new BasicAuthentication(YOUR_USER, YOUR_PASSWORD));

	Push.with(session).register(this, YOUR_SENDER_ID);

If you're using Liferay Screens to maintain a session, you can retrieve it and 
use it instead of creating a new one:

	Push.with(SessionContext.createSessionFromCurrentSession()).register(this, YOUR_SENDER_ID);

If you use these example lines of code, make sure to replace `YOUR_SERVER`,
`YOUR_USER`, `YOUR_PASSWORD`, and `YOUR_SENDER_ID` with your own values. 

That's it! You can attach a listener to store the registration ID or to process
the notification sent to the activity (using `onPushNotification()`). You can
also register a receiver and service to process the notification. You can refer
to the
[`PushNotifications`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples)
project (especially its `PushActivity` class) as an example push notifications
implementation. 

It's time to learn how to implement sending push notifications. 

### Sending Push Notifications [](id=sending-push-notifications)

Using the Liferay Push app, sending notifications to your app's users is
straightforward. You can specify the user IDs along with the message content: 

    PushNotificationsDeviceLocalServiceUtil.sendPushNotification(userIds, content);

This
[example hook plugin](https://github.com/nhpatt/push-with-ddl-hook) sends a push
notification each time a user creates a new DDL record or updates an existing
one. 

In your app's `portal.properties` file, you can add a listener for a class by
creating a
[*value.object.listener*](https://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html#Value%20Object)
property, set to a comma separated list of intended listener classes. Here's an
example listener setting for `DDLRecord` objects:

    value.object.listener.com.liferay.portlet.dynamicdatalists.model.DDLRecord=com.liferay.push.hooks.DDLRecordModelListener

Great! Now you know how to configure your Android apps to receive push 
notifications from Liferay.

In this tutorial, you've configured your portal to accommodate push notifications,
registered notification listeners, and implemented sending push notifications.
Way to go!
