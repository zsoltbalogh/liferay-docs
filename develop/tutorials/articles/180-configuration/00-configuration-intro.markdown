# Configuration [](id=configuration)

Many applications provide users a way of setting preferences for their use. In
@product@, this could be as simple as setting a location for a weather display
or as complex as settings for a mail or a time sheet application. 

The Portlet standard defines an API for portlet preferences that can be used for
this sort of thing, but it's limited and for that reason isn't used much.
Instead, many developers have tended to create their own methods for configuring
their applications.

use and full-featured. It's used throughout @product@'s applications, and
