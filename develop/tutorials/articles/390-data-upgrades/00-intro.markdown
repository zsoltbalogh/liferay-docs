# Data Upgrades [](id=data-upgrades)

The development process doesn't end when you first release your application.
Through your own planning, feature requests, and bug reports, developers improve
their applications on a regular basis. 

Sometimes, those changes result in changes to the data structure and underlying
database. When users upgrade, they need a process that transitions them to
improved versions of your application. For this, you must create an upgrade
process. 

This section shows how to do that.
