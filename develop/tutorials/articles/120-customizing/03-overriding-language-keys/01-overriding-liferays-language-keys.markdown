# Overriding Global Language Keys [](id=overriding-global-language-keys)

Language files contain 
[translations of your application's user interface
messages](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/localizing-your-application).
But you can also override the default language keys globally and in other
applications (including your own). Here are the steps for overriding 
language keys:

1.  [Determine the language keys to override](#determine-the-language-keys-to-override)
2.  [Override the keys in a new language properties file](#override-the-keys-in-a-new-language-properties-file)
3.  [Create a Resource Bundle service component](#create-a-resource-bundle-service-component)

**Note:** Many applications that were once part of Liferay Portal 6.2 are now
modularized. Their language keys might have been moved out of Liferay's language
properties files and into one of the application's modules. The process for
[overriding a module's language keys](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/overriding-a-modules-language-keys)
is different from the process for overriding Liferay's language keys.

## Determine the language keys to override [](id=determine-the-language-keys-to-override)

So how do you find global language keys? They're in the `Language[xx_XX].properties`
files in the source code or your bundle.

-   From the source:

    `/portal-impl/src/content/Language[xx_XX].properties`

-   From a bundle:

    `portal-impl.jar`

All language properties files contain properties you can override, like the
language settings properties:

    ##
    ## Language settings
    ##

    ...
    lang.user.name.field.names=prefix,first-name,middle-name,last-name,suffix
    lang.user.name.prefix.values=Dr,Mr,Ms,Mrs
    lang.user.name.required.field.names=last-name
    lang.user.name.suffix.values=II,III,IV,Jr,Phd,Sr
    ...

There are also many simple keys you can override to update default messages and
labels.

    ##
    ## Category titles
    ##

    category.admin=Admin
    category.alfresco=Alfresco
    category.christianity=Christianity
    category.cms=Content Management
    ...

For example, Figure 1 shows a button that uses Liferay's `publish` default
language key.
    
    `publish=Publish`
 
![Figure 1: Messages displayed in Liferay's user interface can be customized.](../../../images/standard-publish.png)

Next, you'll learn how to override this key. 

## Override the keys in a new language properties file [](id=override-the-keys-in-a-new-language-properties-file)

Once you know the keys to override, create a language properties file for the
locale you want (or the default `Language.properties` file) in your module's
`src/main/resources/content` folder. In your file, define the keys your way. For
example, you could override the `publish` key.

    publish=Publish Override

To enable your change, you must create a resource bundle service component to
reference your language file. 

### Create a Resource Bundle service component [](id=create-a-resource-bundle-service-component)

In your module, create a class that extends `java.util.ResourceBundle` for the
locale you're overriding. Here's an example resource bundle class for the
`en_US` locale:

    @Component(
        property = { "language.id=en_US" }, 
        service = ResourceBundle.class
    )
    public class MyEnUsResourceBundle extends ResourceBundle {

        @Override
        protected Object handleGetObject(String key) {
            return _resourceBundle.getObject(key);
        }

        @Override
        public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
            return _resourceBundle.getKeys();
        }

        private final ResourceBundle _resourceBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(
            "content.Language_en_US", UTF8Control.INSTANCE);

    }

The class's `_resourceBundle` field is assigned a `ResourceBundle`. The call to
`ResourceBundle.getBundle` needs two parameters. The `content.Language_en_US`
parameter is the language file's qualified name with respect to the module's
`src/main/resources` folder. The second parameter is a `control` that sets the
language syntax of the resource bundle. To use language syntax identical to
Liferay's syntax, import Liferay's
`com.liferay.portal.kernel.language.UTF8Control` class and set the second
parameter to `UTF8Control.INSTANCE`.

The class's `@Component` annotation declares it an OSGi `ResourceBundle` service
component. It's `language.id` property designates it for the `en_US` locale. 

    @Component(
        property = { "language.id=en_US" }, 
        service = ResourceBundle.class
    )

The class overrides these methods:

-   **`handleGetObject`:** Looks up the key in the module's resource bundle 
    (which is based on the module's language properties file) and returns the
    key's value as an `Object`. 

-   **`getKeys`:** Returns an `Enumeration` of the resource bundle's keys. 

Your resource bundle service component redirects the default language keys to
your module's language key overrides.

**Note**: Global language key overrides for multiple locales require a separate
module for each locale. Each module's `ResourceBundle` extension class (like the
`MyEnUsResourceBundle` class above) must specify its locale in the `language.id`
component property definition and in the language file qualified name parameter.
For example, here is what they look like for the Spanish locale.

Component definition:

    @Component(
        property = { "language.id=es_ES" }, 
        service = ResourceBundle.class
    )

Resource bundle assignment:

    private final ResourceBundle _resourceBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(
        "content.Language_es_ES", UTF8Control.INSTANCE);

$$$

**Important**: If your module
[uses language keys from another module](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/localizing-your-application#using-a-language-module)
and
[overrides any of that other module's keys](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/localizing-your-application#using-a-language-module-from-a-module),
make sure to use OSGi headers to specify the capabilities your module requires
and provides. This lets you prioritize resource bundles from the modules. 

To see your Liferay language key overrides in action,
[deploy your module](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/starting-module-development#building-and-deploying-a-module)
and visit the portlets and pages that use the keys. 

![Figure 2: This button uses the overridden `publish` key.](../../../images/localized-publish.png)

That's all there is to overriding Liferay's language keys.
