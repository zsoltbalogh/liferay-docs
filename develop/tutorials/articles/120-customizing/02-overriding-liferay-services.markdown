# Overriding Liferay Services (Service Wrappers) [](id=customizing-liferay-services-service-wrappers)

Why might you need to customize Liferay services? Perhaps you've added a new
field to Liferay's `User` object and you want its value to be saved whenever the
`addUser` or `updateUser` methods of Liferay's API are called. Or maybe you want
to add some additional logging functionality to some Liferay APIs or other
services built using 
[Service Builder](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/service-builder).
Whatever your case may be, Liferay's service wrappers provide easy-to-use
extension points for customizing Liferay's services.

To create a module that overrides one of Liferay's services, follow the 
[Service Wrapper Template](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-service-wrapper-template)
reference article to create a `servicewrapper` project type.

As an example, here's the `UserLocalServiceOverride` class that's  generated in
the Service Wrapper Template tutorial:

    package com.liferay.docs.serviceoverride;

    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.service.UserLocalServiceWrapper;
    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.service.ServiceWrapper;
    import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component;

    @Component(
        immediate = true,
        property = {
        },
        service = ServiceWrapper.class
    )
    public class UserLocalServiceOverride extends UserLocalServiceWrapper {

        public UserLocalServiceOverride() {
            super(null);
        }

    }

Notice that you must specify the fully qualified class name of the service
wrapper class that you want to extend. The `service` argument was used in full
in this import statement:

    import com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceWrapper

This import statement, in turn, allowed the short form of the service wrapper
class name to be used in the class declaration of your component class:

    public class UserLocalServiceOverride extends UserLocalServiceWrapper

The bottom line is that when using `blade create` to create a service wrapper
project, you must specify a fully qualified class name as the `service`
argument. (This is also true when using `blade create` to create a service
project.) For information about creating service projects, please see the
[Service Builder](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/service-builder)
tutorial.

The generated `UserLocalServiceOverride` class does not actually customize any
Liferay service. Before you can test that your service wrapper module actually
works, you need to override at least one service method.

Open your `UserLocalServiceOverride` class and add the following methods:

    @Override
    public int authenticateByEmailAddress(long companyId, String emailAddress,
            String password, Map<String, String[]> headerMap,
            Map<String, String[]> parameterMap, Map<String, Object> resultsMap)
        throws PortalException {

        System.out.println(
            "Authenticating user by email address " + emailAddress);
        return super.authenticateByEmailAddress(companyId, emailAddress, password,
            headerMap, parameterMap, resultsMap);
    }

    @Override
    public User getUser(long userId) throws PortalException {
        System.out.println("Getting user by id " + userId);
        return super.getUser(userId);
    }

Each of these methods overrides a Liferay service method. These implementations
merely execute a few print statements that before executing the original service
implementations.

Lastly, you must add the following method to the bottom of your service wrapper
so it can find the appropriate service it's overriding on deployment.

    @Reference(unbind = "-")
    private void serviceSetter(UserLocalService userLocalService) {
        setWrappedService(userLocalService);
    }

[Build and deploy your module](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/starting-module-development#building-and-deploying-a-module).
Congratulations! You've created and deployed a Liferay service wrapper!
