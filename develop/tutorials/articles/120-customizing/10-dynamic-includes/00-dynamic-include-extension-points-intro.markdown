# Dynamic Includes [](id=dynamic-includes)

Dynamic includes expose extension points in JSPs for injecting additional 
HTML, adding resources, modifying editors, and more. Several dynamic includes
are available. Once you know the dynamic include's key, you can
use it to 
[create a module to inject your content](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/customizing-jsps-with-dynamic-includes). 

This section of tutorials lists the available dynamic include keys, along with a 
description of their use cases and a code example. 

The following extension points are covered in this section of tutorials:
