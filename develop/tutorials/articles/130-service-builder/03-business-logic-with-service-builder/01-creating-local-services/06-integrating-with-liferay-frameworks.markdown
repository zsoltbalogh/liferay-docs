# Integrating with Liferay's Frameworks [](id=integrating-with-liferays-frameworks)

New car buyers expect certain features to be standard: power windows, cruise
control, floor mats (at least the cheap ones), and so on. Similarly, users
expect applications to have certain features and expect those features to behave
consistently across applications. 

For example, a user might expect the app's content can be shared socially
on Twitter and Facebook. The user might expect a way to tag and rate the app
content, and a way to comment on it. You must meet, and even exceed, these
expectations. Liferay's frameworks implement these features users know and love.
Integrating with the frameworks is straightforward and the frameworks provide
intuitive, consistent user experiences. 

Here are some of Liferay's most popular frameworks:

- [Permissions](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/defining-application-permissions):
Defines resource for entities and actions for performing on the resources. 

- [Configurable Applications](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configurable-applications):
Makes applications configurable from within the Control Panel. 

- [Workflow](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow):
Equips entities for reviewing in workflows before publishing. 

- [Item Selector](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/item-selector): 
Provides a consistent developer experience for browsing and selecting entities. 

- [Asset Framework](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/asset-framework): 
Makes entities more descriptive enabling users to tag, categorize, rate,
prioritize, and comment on them. It enables users to relate entities to each
other as assets and it allows the entities to be published in the Asset
Publisher. 

    - [Tags and Categories](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/implementing-asset-categorization-and-tagging):
    Enables users to tag entities and categorize the tagged entities. 
    - [Priority](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/implementing-asset-priority):
    Users can ascribe numerical priorities to entities. 
    - [Related Assets](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/relating-assets):
    Users can associate one entity with another as an asset. 
    - [Asset Renderer](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/rendering-an-asset):
    Enables displaying entities in the Asset Publisher. 
    - [Comments](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/adding-comments-to-your-app):
    Lets users comment on entities.
    - [Ratings](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/rating-assets):
    Enables rating systems, such as five stars or thumbs up/down, on entities. 
    - [Flags](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/flagging-inappropriate-asset-content):
    Users can flag entity content as inappropriate. 
    - *Social Bookmarks*:
    Users can share entity content on Twitter, Facebook, and more. 
    ([Tutorials](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LRDOCS-4531) are coming soon.)

- [Export/Import](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/export-import-and-staging):
Lets users export entity data to and import entity data from files (`.lpkg`
files). Exported data can be imported to another portal instance or saved for
later use. 

- [Staging](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/export-import-and-staging): 
Lets users change entities behind the scenes without affecting the live site. 

- *Search*: Enables entities to be found and shown in @product@ search results. 
([Tutorials](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LRDOCS-4372) are coming soon.)

- *Recycle Bin*: Entities can be moved from the application and put them into the 
Recycle Bin. Entities can be restored from the Recycle Bin or deleted
permanently (manually or per a schedule).
([Tutorials](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LRDOCS-4505) are coming soon.)
