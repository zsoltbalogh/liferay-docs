# Dynamic Query [](id=dynamic-query)

Though you can use custom SQL queries with Service Builder to retrieve data
from the database, sometimes it's more convenient to build queries dynamically
at runtime. You can do this with Liferay's Dynamic Query API, which wraps
Hibernate's Criteria API. The Dynamic Query API lets you build queries without
writing any SQL. It helps you think in terms of objects and member variables
instead of tables and columns. Complex queries can be significantly easier to
understand and maintain than the equivalent custom SQL (or HQL) queries. While
you technically don't need to know SQL to construct Dynamic Queries, you still
must take care to construct efficient queries. For information on Hibernate's
Criteria API, please see 
[Hibernate's manual](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.0/userguide/html_single/chapters/query/criteria/Criteria.html).
This tutorial demonstrates creating custom finders for Liferay applications
using Service Builder and Dynamic Query API.

To use Liferay's Dynamic Query API, you need to create a finder implementation
for your model entity. You can
[define model entities in `service.xml`](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/defining-an-object-relational-map-with-service-builder)
and
[run Service Builder](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/running-service-builder)
to generate model, persistence, and service layers for your application. This
tutorial assumes that you're creating a Liferay application consisting of a
service module, an API module, and a web module. Once you've used Service
Builder to generate model, persistence, and service layers for your application,
follow these steps to call custom finders using the Dynamic Query API:

1.  [Define a custom finder method](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/defining-a-custom-finder-method).

2.  [Implement your finder using the Dynamic Query API](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/implementing-a-custom-finder-method-using-dynamic-query).

3.  [Add a method to your `*LocalServiceImpl` class that invokes your finder method](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/accessing-your-custom-finder-method-from-the-service-layer). 

Once you've taken these steps, you can access your custom finder as a service
method. Note: You can create multiple or overloaded `findBy*` finder methods in
your `*FinderImpl` class. Next, you'll examine these steps in more detail.
