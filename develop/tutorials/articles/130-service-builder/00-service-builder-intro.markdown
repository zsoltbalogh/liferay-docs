# Service Builder [](id=service-builder)

An application without reliable business logic or persistence isn't much of an
application at all. Unfortunately, writing your own persistence code often takes
a great deal of time. Fortunately, Liferay provides the Liferay Service Builder
to generate it for you. You might now be thinking, "What?! I hate code
generators!" Not to fear; you can still write your own persistence code if you
wish. And if you choose to use Service Builder, you can edit and customize the
code it generates. Regardless of how you produce your persistence code, you can
then use Service Builder to implement your app's business logic. 

These tutorials shows you how to use Service Builder to generate your
persistence framework and implement your business logic. They also demonstrate
using Spring in your app.
