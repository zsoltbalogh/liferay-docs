# Workflow [](id=workflow)

Use the workflow framework to run assets through a business process that suit your
organization's needs. Workflow processes are created using XML or via the handy
[Kaleo Designer](https://customer.liferay.com/documentation/7.1/admin/-/official_documentation/portal/kaleo-designer)
tool that comes with DE subscriptions.

This set of tutorials delves into the following workflow framework topics:

- Creating Workflow Definitions (using XML)
- Enabling Assets for Workflow
- Creating Workflow Engine Adapters

To manage workflow definitions and define their assignment schemes, check out
the [workflow section of the administrator documentation](LINK)(not yet
written).
