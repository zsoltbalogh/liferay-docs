# Portlets and Themes [](id=portlets-and-themes-intro)

The default theme sets the basic look and feel for all your portlets, and,
through Portlet Decorators, gives you a way to fine-tune the look of individual
portlets with the click of a mouse. But you aren't limited to defaults. The
following sections explain 

- how to modify themes to create custom templates for your portlets 

- how to create your own decorators to customize the look of your portlets
individually 

- how to embed portlets in your themes, a function that lets you choose
portlets to deploy automatically on any page where a given theme is used.
