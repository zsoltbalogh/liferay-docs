# Creating Configurable Styles for Portlet Wrappers [](id=creating-configurable-styles-for-portlet-wrappers)

Portlet Decorators customize the style of an application's wrapper. If you 
inspect the markup of your application when it's on a page you'll observe that 
it is wrapped by two layers. Among other things, these layers provide some 
common basic features like drag and drop and the application border style. 
In order to protect these features, you can't modify the markup of these layers 
directly with a theme. 

With Portlet Decorators, you can add a CSS class to one of these wrapping layers 
via a user's setting. By defining styles for this class in your theme, you can 
change the look and feel of the application instances where the Portlet 
Decorator is applied, including its wrapper. 

The figure below shows the markup of the layers wrapping a @product@ application 
when the *Decorate* Portlet Decorator is applied:

Once your Portlet Decorator is complete, apply it to your applications 
through the [Look and Feel Configuration menu](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/look-and-feel-configuration).

The tutorials in this section detail how to customize Portlet Decorators and 
apply them to your applications.
