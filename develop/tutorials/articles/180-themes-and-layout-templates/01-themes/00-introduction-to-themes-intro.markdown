# Themes [](id=introduction-to-themes)

A Theme provides the overall look and feel for a site. Themes are a 
combination of CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and FreeMarker templates. Although the
default themes are nice, you may wish to create your own custom look and feel
for your site. 

@product@ provides an easy-to-use tool called the 
[Liferay Theme Generator](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-themes) 
that helps automate the theme development process, but you can use other tools 
and environments, such as 
[@ide@](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-themes-with-liferay-ide)
or 
[Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/blade-cli)'s 
[Theme Template](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/theme-template) 
to create themes.

Themes created with the Liferay Theme Generator give you access to several 
[theme gulp tasks](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/developing-themes) 
that offer basic functions, such as 
[`build`](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/building-your-themes-files) 
and 
[`deploy`](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/deploying-your-theme), 
as well as more complex interactions, such as 
[auto deploying when a change is made](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/automatically-deploying-theme-changes) 
and 
[setting the base theme](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/changing-your-base-theme).

What if you only wish to make a minor change to the overall look and feel? Let's
say you just want to change a menu animation. Instead of creating an entire
theme for this single modification, you can 
[create a Themelet](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-reusable-pieces-of-code-for-your-themes).
Themelets are modular, customizable, reusable, shareable pieces of code that 
extend a theme. They enable reusable code for themes. Instead of rewriting the 
code each time, you can use the same themelet in each theme.

Liferay has its own set of base themes, called 
[styled](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/7.1.x/modules/apps/frontend-theme/frontend-theme-styled) 
and 
[unstyled](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/7.1.x/modules/apps/frontend-theme/frontend-theme-unstyled) 
that create the default look and feel you see at first start. The *styled* theme 
inherits from the *unstyled* theme, and simply adds some additional styling on 
top. These same base themes are used to create a custom theme. 

Using a base theme as your foundation, you can then make your customizations to 
the theme files. To modify the theme, mirror the folder structure of the files 
you wish to change and copy them into your theme. Place the modified files in 
the `src` folder of your theme if using the Liferay Theme Generator, or copy 
them into the `_diffs` folder of your theme if using Liferay IDE. Build the 
theme to apply the changes.

Once your theme is developed it is packaged as a WAR (Web application ARchive)
file and can be deployed to the server, either manually or using build tools.

Once your theme is deployed, apply it to your pages through the 
[Look and Feel menu](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/page-set-look-and-feel).

The only limitation is your imagination.
