# Creating Themes [](id=creating-themes)

The Liferay Theme Generator lets you create themes, themelets, layout templates 
and more. There are a few dependencies required to run the generator. If you 
have NodeJS installed, you're already one step ahead. 

Follow these steps to install the Liferay Theme Generator and generate a theme:

1.  Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). We recommend installing the Long Term 
    Support (LTS) version. Note that Node Package Manager (npm) is installed 
    with this as well. You'll use npm to install the remaining dependencies and 
    generator. 

2.  Use npm to install 
    [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), 
    [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), 
    and the Liferay Theme Generator:

        npm install -g yo gulp generator-liferay-theme
        
    If you're on Windows, follow the instructions in step 2a to install Sass, 
    otherwise you can skip to step 3.

    a.  To use Sass on Windows, you must use either Sass from node-sass or Sass 
        from Ruby. By default, the generator uses node-sass, but this also 
        requires that you have Visual Studio on windows, along with 
        [node-gyp and Python installed](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation). 
        Since Visual Studio is a particularly large dependency, **if you don't 
        already have it installed**, we recommend you install Ruby Sass instead. 
        Install Ruby via the 
        [Ruby installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/), 
        and then install the compass gem:

        gem install compass
    
    The matching sass gem is automatically fetched and installed as well.
    
3.  Run the generator and follow the prompts to create your theme:

        yo liferay-theme

4.  cd into your theme and run `gulp deploy` to deploy your new theme to the 
    server.
    
Now you have a powerful theme development tool at your disposal. The sky is the 
limit!
