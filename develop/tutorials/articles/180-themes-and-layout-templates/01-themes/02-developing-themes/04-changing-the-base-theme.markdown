# Changing Your Base Theme [](id=changing-your-base-theme)

Once your theme is 
[built](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/building-your-themes-files), 
you can use the `gulp extend` task to change your theme's base theme. 

Follow these steps to change your base theme:

1.  Navigate to your theme's root folder and run `gulp extend` and choose option 
    1 to change the base theme your theme extends.

2.  Choose which base theme you want to extend. By default, themes created with 
    the 
    [Liferay Theme Generator](https://github.com/liferay/generator-liferay-theme) 
    are based off of the 
    [styled theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/liferay-theme-styled). You can 
    extend the styled or unstyled base theme, a globally installed theme, or a 
    theme published on the npm registry.

3.  Your theme's `package.json` contains the updated base theme configuration :

        {
          ...
        	"liferayTheme": {
        		"baseTheme": "styled",
        		"screenshot": "",
        		"rubySass": false,
        		"templateLanguage": "ftl",
        		"version": "7.1"
        	},
          ...
        }
        
When you 
[build your theme's files](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/building-your-themes-files) 
or 
[deploy it](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/deploying-your-theme), 
your theme will inherit the updated base theme's files.
