# Copying an Existing Theme's Files [](id=copying-an-existing-themes-files)

If you want to jump start developing your theme, you can copy an 
existing theme's files and build on top of them. The `gulp kickstart` task 
automates this process for you. It copies another theme's css, images, js, and 
templates into the `src` directory of your own. While this is similar to 
extending your theme with a base theme or a themelet, kickstarting from another 
theme is a one time inheritance, whereas extending from another theme is a 
dynamic inheritance that applies your `src` files on top of the base theme on 
every build.

**Note:** The gulp kickstart task copies an existing theme's files into your own, 
which can potentially overwrite files with the same name. Proceed with caution.

To kickstart your theme, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to your theme's root folder and run `gulp kickstart`.

2.  Select where the theme is located. You can copy files from globally 
    installed themes, themes published on the npm registry, or the classic 
    theme.

3.  The theme's files are copied into your own theme, jump starting 
    development.
