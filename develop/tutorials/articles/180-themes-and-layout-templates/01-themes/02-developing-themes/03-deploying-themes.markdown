# Deploying Your Theme [](id=deploying-your-theme)

To deploy your theme to your app server, run the `gulp deploy` task. The `gulp 
deploy` task 
[builds your theme's files](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/building-your-themes-files), 
and deploys the generated WAR file to the 
[app server you configured](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-your-themes-app-server) 
when you 
[created the theme](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-themes).
