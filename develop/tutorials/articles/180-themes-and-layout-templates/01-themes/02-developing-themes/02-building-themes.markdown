# Building Your Theme's Files [](id=building-your-themes-files)

The `gulp build` task generates the base theme files, compiles Sass into CSS, 
and zips all theme files into a WAR file that you can deploy to your server. 

Follow these steps to build your theme's files:

1.  Navigate to your theme's root folder and run `gulp build`.

2.  A new `build` folder is created with all your theme's files. You can copy 
    these files and folders to your theme's `src` folder to modify the theme.

3.  Your theme's files are zipped into a `war` file in a new `dist` folder. 
    Deploy the `war` file to your app server to make it available.
