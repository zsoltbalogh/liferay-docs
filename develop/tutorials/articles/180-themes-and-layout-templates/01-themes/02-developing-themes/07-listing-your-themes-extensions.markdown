# Listing Your Theme's Extensions [](id=listing-your-themes-extensions)

Do you need to know what base theme/themelets your theme extends? There's a gulp 
task for that. While you can manually check your theme's `package.json` for this 
information, the `gulp status` task displays this information for you. Navigate 
to your theme's root folder and run `gulp status` to display your theme's 
extensions.
