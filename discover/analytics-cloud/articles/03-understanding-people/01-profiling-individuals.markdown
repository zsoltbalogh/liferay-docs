# Profiling Individuals [](id=profiling-individuals)

Many individuals visit your sites. Learning who they are and their activities
and interests helps you improve business with them. Individual profiles help
your Sales, Customer Service, and Customer Relations teams work personally with
them. The profiles help you gain more context on what people do on your websites
and their interests, so you can communicate with them intelligently according to
their needs. 

Here's how to view Individual profiles:

1. Select *Individuals* from the left navigation panel. The *Individuals* page
   appears, listing individual contacts, so you can page through, search for,
   and select them to learn more about them. 

2. Select an Individual to view these things about the person:

    - Activities on your sites
    - Identity details and properties
    - Topic interests
    - Segment membership

Each Individual profile has these tabs:

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Details](#details)
- [Interests](#interests)
- [Segments](#segments)

Let's explore them to learn more about people you do business with. 

## Overview [](id=overview)

The Overview tab shows the person's recent activities using a histogram of the
customer's activities and frequency in the past 90 days. The activities include
page views, downloads, and form submissions. If you click on a specific day, it
lists the Touchpoints (pages and assets) the customer acted on during that day
only.

The Overview tab also gives you a glimpse of a person's profile data, topics of
interest, and associated audience segments. Clicking the *View all ...* link
for the Details, Interests, or Segments summary opens its respective tab. 

Click on the *Details* tab to explore an Individual's details. 

## Details [](id=details)

The Details tab shows all of the person's attributes, the data sources they came
from, and when they were last modified. 

## Interests [](id=interests)

Click on the *Interests* tab. 

Depending on the web pages or assets a user interacts with, Analytics Cloud uses
an advanced algorithm to find out what an individual's interests are with your
brand. This helps you prepare for conversations with the individual or create
campaigns based on the interests. 

See
[Customer Insights](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/blob/master/discover/analytics-cloud/articles/03-understanding-people/04-customer-insights.markdown)
for details on the Interests insight.

## Segments [](id=segments)

The Segments tab lists all the Segments the customer belongs to. Analyzing
Segments helps you learn about the Individual and similar Individuals.
Satisfying Segments of customers generates new business fast. Segments are
explained in detail next.
