# Learning What Makes Customers Happier [](id=learning-what-makes-customers-happier)

Analytics Cloud creates a single source of truth that brings together the
various facets of customer knowledge to paint a more rounded, more informed
picture of each customer and his or her behavior. It gives you a single customer
view.

Here, your business users access a single location in which to view and manage
customer data compiled from your customer data sources---DXP sites and customer
CSV files. Analytics Cloud can merge customer data your way, into a model that
works best for you.

This foundation reveals insights into individual customer behavior, such as how
often individuals visit your sites, the content they read, and the products they
browse.  The analytics identifies positive and negative customer experiences.
While you and your teammates might individually know parts of these things,
providing this information in one place allows for highly targeted communication
and marketing efforts.
