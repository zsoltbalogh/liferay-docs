# Customer Insights [](id=customer-insights)

Finding out topics people are interested in helps you relate your products and
services to them. Analytics Cloud's Interests insight empowers you with rich,
easy-to-understand visuals that provide this information. 

## Interests [](id=interests)

As an Individual interacts with the pages and assets, Analytics Cloud notes the
topics they contain. The more an Individual visits pages and assets that contain
a topic, the higher the topic's ranking is for that Individual's Segments. 

![Figure 1: Clicking on an Interest topic for a Segment (or Individual) shows a histogram of the Segment's interaction with pages and assets mentioning the topic. In this figure, *Intranets* is the selected topic. Clicking on a histogram point shows the pages and assets viewed during that time period.](../../images/interests-insight.png)

For example, say your site has pages that mention these topics:

- Clothing
- Sports

If an Individual named Michael frequents these pages, the Interest ranking for
the *clothing* and *sports* topics is high. Here are a couple of different ways
you could use this information:

- If you sell sports apparel, you could prepare a campaign for selling sports 
  apparel to Michael.

- If you don't sell sports apparel, you could use the Interest data to convince 
  sports apparel vendors to advertise on your site.

Either way, the Interests insight helps generate new business. The Interests
insight tells you the most common topics mentioned by the pages and assets
customers visit most.
