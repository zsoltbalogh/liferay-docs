# Profiling Segments [](id=profiling-segments)

The Segment profiles are your gateway into how people interact with your
sites. They show who's matching your Segment criteria
([Dynamic Segments](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/blob/master/discover/analytics-cloud/articles/03-understanding-people/02-creating-segments.markdown)),
so you can deliver content that wows them. 

Here's how to view Segment profiles:

1. Select *Segments* from the navigation panel. The *Segments* page appears,
   listing individual Segments. You can page through, search for, and select
   Segments to learn more about them. 

2. Select a Segment to learn these things about it:

    - *Membership:* Population fluctuation over time.  
    - *Topics of interest:* Topics mentioned in the pages and assets the Segment visits most. 
    - *Distribution:* Demographics based on Individual properties

The Segment's profile appears, showing its *Overview* panel. 

## Overview [](id=overview)

The *Overview* tab's main area shows membership growth. As a marketer, you might
want to generate more customer prospects in a specific industry. If you create a
Dynamic Segment with that industry as criterion, you can view its membership
histogram to monitor customer growth in that industry.

The Overview tab also gives you a glimpse of the Segment's criteria, interests,
and demographics. Each one links to more details, or you can click on their
respective tabs. 

## Interests [](id=interests)

As a Segment's members interact with your site pages and assets, Analytics
Cloud's interests algorithm determines the level of interest the Segment has
with your site's topics. Knowing these topics helps you prepare for conversing
with the Segment members and create content that interests them. 

See
[Customer Insights](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/blob/master/discover/analytics-cloud/articles/03-understanding-people/04-customer-insights.markdown)
for details on the Interests insight.

## Distribution [](id=distribution)

The *Distribution* tab breaks down the Segment by a demographic property. 

For example, select a property such as *Job Title* to dissect your Segment
further. A bar chart appears, displaying a distribution of the Segment member
population by Job Title. As a marketer, you could use this information to
identify a subset of the Segment to focus a marketing campaign on. 

You've completed touring Segment profiles. Creating Segments and analyzing their
profiles is key to learning more about your customers.
