# Tracking Usage [](id=tracking-usage)

Analytics Cloud plans are limited by the total amount of Individuals and Pages
Views synced from data sources. When either limit is exceeded, you must either
upgrade your plan or purchase add-ons to accommodate the overage. 

![Figure 1: The Usage page reports when you're approaching or exceeding your plan limits.](../../images/current-usage.png)

The plans and add-ons are described on the right side of the page. 

## Plans [](id=plans)

The *Plans* section describes each plan's limits and cost. The higher tier plans
cost more initially but offer more flexibility through higher limits and less
expensive add-ons. Your current plan is highlighted. You can upgrade from lower
tier to higher tier plans. 

## Add-ons [](id=add-ons)

Add-ons increase limits on Individuals or Page Views, without requiring you to
upgrade to a new plan. Purchasing add-ons gives you commitment-free analytics
capacity boosts. 

Contact your sales representative for further guidance on getting a plan that
fits you.
