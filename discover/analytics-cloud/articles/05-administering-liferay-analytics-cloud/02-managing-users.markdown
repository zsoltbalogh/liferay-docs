# Managing Users [](id=managing-users)

If you're the project *Owner* (Liferay invited you by email) or have been
assigned the *Admin* permission, you can invite and manage users. Here's how to
bring up the User Management page:

1. Click on *Settings* in the navigation panel. The default Settings page
   appears. 

2. Click on *User Management* in the navigation area. The *User Management*
   page appears, listing all the project's users. 

From the *User Management* page, an Admin user (or Owner) can invite users, edit
their permissions, and delete them. 

If your project is new, you'll want to invite your teammates to the project. 

## Inviting Users [](id=inviting-users)

It's exciting to give and receive invitations. Carry that excitement with you
as you invite your team's analysts, data integrators, and marketers to your
Analytics Cloud project. 

1. In the *User Management* page, click on the *Invite Users* button. The
   *Invite Users* dialog appears. 

2. Enter the email addresses (separated by a space or comma) of the people to
   invite to the project. 

3. Click the *Send* button. The invitation is sent to your lucky teammates.

You can set the user's permissions when their invitation acceptance is pending. 

## Managing Permissions [](id=managing-permissions)

Analytics Cloud projects have these permission Roles:

**Owner:** Can do all things, but cannot be deleted. 

**Admin:** Can do all things, including manage other Admin users. Admin users can 
be deleted. 

**Member:** Can view all profiles and analytics, but cannot edit anything under
Settings. They cannot manage users, or add or remove data sources. 

Here's how to change a user's permission Role:

1. Click the *Edit* button in the user's list entry. 

2. In the *Permission* column, select the user's current permission.
   A permission Role selector appears. 

3. Select the permission Role for the user. 

The user is assigned the selected Role. That's all there is to it!
