# Documents and Media Analytics [](id=documents-and-media-analytics)

[Documents and Media files](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/managing-documents-and-media) 
are assets you want site users to look at or download. 

Are your Documents and Media engaging site visitors? Analytics Cloud can give
you important insights.

## Visitor Behavior [](id=visitor-behavior)

The Overview tab of an Asset's detail presents several data presentations. The
first chart, called Visitor Behavior, contains four important metrics:

- Total Downloads
- Total Previews
- Total Comments
- Average Rating

![Figure 2: The Visitors Behavior chart contains important trend lines.](../../images/assets-dm-vb.png)

### Downloads [](id=downloads)

The Downloads trend-line shows the total number of downloads per day (or hour,
if *Yesterday* or *Last 24 Hours* are selected) over the selected time period.

### Previews [](id=previews)

Documents and Media Documents can be 
[previewed](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/viewing-file-previews). 
Even if not ultimately downloaded, previewing shows interaction with the
file and is therefore an important metric. The Previews trend line shows the
total number of previews per day (or hour, if *Yesterday* or *Last 24 Hours* are
selected) for the selected time period.

### Comments [](id=comments)

Comments can be allowed on Documents and Media files. If enabled, the Comments
trend line shows the total number of Comments on a file per day (or hour, if
*Yesterday* or *Last 24 Hours* are selected) over the selected time period.

### Rating [](id=rating)

Ratings can be enabled on Documents and Media. Whether the rating is a simple
Thumb Up/Thumbs Down, or a Stars rating (0-5 Stars), the Rating in Analytics
Cloud is a calculation that lets you compare how Users evaluate the Site's
Documents and Media Files.

## Views by Segment [](id=views-by-segment)

Scroll down from the Visitor Behavior chart to see the Views by Segment bar
graph, which is present for all Asset types and Pages.

The Views by Segment bar graph shows how many times the Asset was viewed by up
to the top seven Segments over the selected time period. If more than seven
Segments viewed the Asset, the top six are displayed, and views by the remaining
Segments are aggregated in the seventh bar on the graph, labeled _X More
Segments_.

## Downloads by Location [](id=downloads-by-location)

View a bubble chart to compare the Downloads by country over the selected period. Up
to the top five countries are displayed, and the sixth bubble is an aggregation
of the remaining countries.

## Views by Technology [](id=views-by-technology)

View a stacked bar graph of the Page's views by operating system (grouped by
device type) in the default tab.

![Figure 5: What technologies are used to interact with the Asset?](../../images/assets-dm-dbt.png)

Click *Web Browser* to see a donut chart displaying up to the top eight web
browsers over the selected time period. If applicable, remaining web browsers
are aggregated in the ninth donut segment.

## Asset Appears On [](id=asset-appears-on)

The Asset Appears On table includes a Page Name and URL. Like any Page data in
Analytics Cloud, only Pages that were interacted with in some way by site
visitors are tracked and reported. It's important to note that the link
doesn't take you to the actual Page with the Asset on it. Instead, it leads to
the Page Analytics view of the Page. From there you can click the URL to the
actual Page.
