# Backing Up Your Search Engine [](id=backing-up-your-search-engine)

@product@'s search solution is pluggable. Once you [install a search engine and
configure the appropriate
adapter](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-a-search-engine),
you're using a standalone installation of the search engine (usually installed
on a cluster of servers) to create and manage your search indices. That means
thereâ€™s really nothing special to do in the @product@ installation when backing
up your search engine's data. In large part, these articles summarize the
process and point you to the relevant documentation on backing up Elasticsearch
and Solr, the two search engines supported for plugging into Liferay.
