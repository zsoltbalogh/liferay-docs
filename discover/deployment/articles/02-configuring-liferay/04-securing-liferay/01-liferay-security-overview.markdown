# @product@ Security Overview [](id=liferay-portal-security-overview)

Liferay follows the OWASP Top 10 (2013) and CWE/SANS Top 25 lists to ensure
that @product@ is as secure as possible. Following these recommendations protects
the portal against known kinds of attacks and security vulnerabilities. For
example, @product@'s persistence layer is generated and maintained by the Service
Builder framework which prevents SQL Injection using Hibernate and parameter
based queries.

To prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS), user-submitted values are escaped on
output. To support integration features, @product@ doesn't encode input. Data is
stored in the original form as submitted by the user. @product@ includes built-in
protection against CSRF attacks, Local File Inclusion, Open Redirects,
Uploading and serving files of dangerous types, Content Sniffing, Clickjacking,
Path Traversal, and many other common attacks.

To stay on top, @product@ also contains fixes for state-of-the-art attacks and
techniques to improve product security. For example, @product@ uses PBKDF2 to
store passwords. @product@ also contains mitigation for Quadratic Blowup XXE
attack, Rosetta Flash vulnerability, Reflected File Download, and other kinds
of attacks.

## Authentication Overview [](id=authentication-overview)

@product@ user authentication can take place using any of a variety of prepared
solutions:

- Form authentication using the Sign In Portlet with extensible adapters for
  checking and storing credentials (portal database, LDAP)
- Single-Sign-On (SSO) solutions - NTLM, CAS, SiteMinder, OpenSSO, OpenID,
  Facebook
- SAML plugin
  ([https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15188711](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15188711))
- JAAS integration with application server

Note: Although Liferay's SSO solutions are incompatible with WebDAV, they can
be used in conjunction with Liferay Sync. See the
[Publishing Files](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/publishing-files) 
article for more information on WebDAV and Liferay Sync.

Remote application authentication and authorization can be done using the
`AuthVerifier` layer:

- Password based HTTP Basic + Digest authentication
- Token based OAuth plugin
- Portal session based solution for JavaScript applications

Both user authentication and remote application authentication are extensible
in @product@. Developers can create custom Login portlets and plugins, extend the
default Login portlet `auth.pipeline`, create `AutoLogin` extensions for SSO,
or create custom `AuthVerifier` implementations.

## Authorization and Permission Checking [](id=authorization-and-permission-checking)

There are several adjustable authorization layers in place to prevent
unauthorized or unsecured access to data:

- Remote IP and HTTPS transport check to limit access to @product@'s Java
  servlets
- Extensible Access Control Policies layer to perform any portal service
  related authorization check
- Extensible role-based permission framework for almost any portal entity or
  data (stored in the portal database or elsewhere)
- Portlet Container security checks to control portlet access
- Remote IP check for portal remote API authentication methods
- Service Access Policies to control access to portal remote API

## Additional Security Features [](id=additional-security-features)

@product@ supports other features, too. @product@ users can be assigned to sites,
teams, user groups, or organizations. Custom roles can be created, permissions
can be assigned to those roles, and those roles can be applied to users. Roles
are scoped to apply only with a specific context like a site, an organization,
or globally. See @product@'s [Roles and Permissions (not yet written)]()
documentation for more information.

Note: @product@ relies on the application server for sanitizing CRLF in
HTTP headers. You should, therefore, make sure this is properly configured in
your application server, or you may experience false positives in reports from
automatic security verification software such as Veracode. There is one
exception to this for Resin, which does not have support for this feature. In
this case, @product@ sanitizes HTTP headers.

There are additional security plugins available from [Liferay Marketplace](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace). For example, you can find an
Audit plugin for tracking user actions or an AntiSamy plugin for clearing HTML
from XSS vectors.

@product@ provides plenty of configuration options that allow its various
security features to be fine-tuned or disabled. Here are a few examples of
these kinds of configuration actions:

- Disable the Sign In portlet's *Create Account* link
- Configure @product@'s HTTPS web server address
- Configure the list of allowed servers to which users can be redirected
- Configure the list of portlets that can be accessed from any page
- Configure the file types allowed to be uploaded and downloaded
- Many other options

## Secure Development Recommendations [](id=secure-development-recommendations)

@product@ also provides tools to fight vulnerabilities in code.

For secure development, it's important to have security-mined colleagues in
your team. These individuals should consider the security aspects of each stage
of the product lifecycle. It's important to start a discussion about security
early in the project-planning stage so that threats to user privacy, data, and
the system can be identified.

Later, during the implementation phase, developers can use the following list
of APIs to address some of the most common vulnerabilities. These APIs should
be used consistently across @product@.

Before releasing a product, it's important to "hack yourself first". I.e., you
should conduct penetration tests or source code reviews to catch the
low-hanging security-flavored fruit. External penetration testing is also an
option for many companies. It's becoming a more popular and less expensive
service.

Here's short list of @product@ security APIs:

- `HtmlUtil` - to prevent XSS
- `HtmlUtil#escapeXPath` - prevent XPath injection
- `AuthTokenUtil#checkCSRFToken` - check CSRF tokens
- `FileUtil#createTempFile*` - prevent file system related issues
- `PortalUtil#escapeRedirect` - prevent open redirects
- `StringUtil#random*` - insecure but random enough strings
- `PwdGenerator#getPassword`, `SecureRandomUtil` â€“ cryptographically strong
  pseudorandom output, optimized for performance
- `PasswordEncryptorUtil` - verification and creation of strong password
  hashes, configured to use PBKDF2 by default
- `DigesterUtil` - SHA-1 hashes, nowadays usable at most for file checksums

## Secure Configuration and Run Recommendations [](id=secure-configuration-and-run-recommendations)

@product@ is built using the "secure by default" concept in mind. Thus,
@product@'s default configuration is already very secure. It's not recommended to
disable built-in protections or to allow all values in security white-lists.
Such acts may lead to security misconfiguration and an insecure @product@
deployment.

For more information about securing a @product@ installation, please see
[https://www.liferay.com/security](https://www.liferay.com/security) and
[https://dev.liferay.com/web/community-security-team](https://dev.liferay.com/web/community-security-team)
and the resources listed on those pages.

Also, @product@ customers are advised to deploy security patches as
described on the customer portal:
[https://www.liferay.com/group/customer/products/portal/security-vulnerability](https://www.liferay.com/group/customer/products/portal/security-vulnerability)

For community and CE deployments, the only way to stay secure is to use always
the latest community version, which contains all previous security patches.
Until a new version is released, the Community Security Team issues patches for
the latest CE version via the
[https://dev.liferay.com/web/community-security-team](https://dev.liferay.com/web/community-security-team)
page.
