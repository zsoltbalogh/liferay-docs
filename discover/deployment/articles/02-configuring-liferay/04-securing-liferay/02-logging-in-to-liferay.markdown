# Logging in to @product@ [](id=logging-in-to-liferay)

One of the primary functions of a web portal is to restrict access to different
pages, content, and web applications. These kinds of portal resources should
only be accessible by the appropriate users. E.g., a student who logs in to a
university portal should not be able to access the same resources that are
available to a professor. Similarly, a patient who logs in to a health care
portal should not be able to access the same resources that are available to a
doctor. Some portal resources (at least a login page) should be available to
users who have not logged in. In @product@, users who have not logged in are
called *guest* users. <!-- To learn more about how @product@ restricts access to
portal resources to different users, please see the [Roles and Permissions]()
documentation. (Not yet written) -->

@product@'s Sign In portlet provides the basic means for users to log in to
@product@. By default, users can also use the Sign In portlet to create new
accounts or to request a password reset. The home page of a default @product@
installation contains a Sign In portlet. You can access this page at
[http://localhost:8080/web/guest/home](http://localhost:8080/web/guest/home) if
you're running @product@ locally.

Even if the Sign In portlet has not been added to any @product@ page that's
accessible to a guest user, users can still access it by navigating to this
URL:

- [localhost:8080/c/portal/login](localhost:8080/c/portal/login)

Note that @product@'s configured authentication type determines the type of
credentials that the user needs to enter in order to log in. @product@ supports
three authentication types: authentication by email address, screen name, or
user ID. To choose an authentication type, navigate to the Control Panel, click
on *Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings* &rarr; *Authentication* and use
the *How do users authenticate?* dropdown to make a selection. Alternatively,
add the following lines to your `portal-ext.properties` file, uncomment the
appropriate line, comment out the others, and restart your @product@ server.

    company.security.auth.type=emailAddress
    #company.security.auth.type=screenName
    #company.security.auth.type=userId

@product@'s default authentication type uses users' email addresses. Users'
screen names or user IDs can be used instead. Screen names are chosen when a
new account is created either by the user or by an administrator. User IDs are
autogenerated by @product@. Regardless of which authentication type is
configured, users must always enter a password to log in to @product@. <!-- For
information on adding restrictions on the kinds of passwords that are allowed
or required (e.g., to require a minimum password length or require special
characters), please see the [Password Policies]() documentation. -->

By default, guest users can create accounts on your portal by clicking on the
*Create Account* link in the Sign In portlet, completing the form, and
submitting it. If a user already has an account but has forgotten its password,
the user can click on the *Forgot Password* link to request a password reset.
Both the *Create Account* form and the *Forgot Password* form include a
CAPTCHA-based text verification field. Using [CAPTCHA](http://www.captcha.net)
prevents bots from submitting these forms. @product@ can be configured to use
[reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html) instead of
CAPTCHA. One advantage of using reCAPTCHA is that it can allow visually
impaired users to pass the test. To configure @product@ to use reCAPTCHA,
navigate to the Control Panel, then click on *System* &rarr; *Server
Administration* &rarr; *CAPTCHA*.

The security requirements of some web portals require that all user accounts be
created by administrators. @product@ supports this use case by allowing the
*Create Account* to be removed. To prevent guest users from creating new user
accounts, navigate to the Control Panel, click on *Configuration* &rarr;
*Instance Settings* &rarr; *Authentication* and uncheck the *Allow strangers to
create accounts?* box. You can also disallow users from requesting forgotten
passwords or from requesting password reset links by unchecking the appropriate
boxes. <!-- For further information about @product@'s authentication options,
please see this [documentation]() (not yet written). -->

Remember that using the Sign In portlet provides the most basic way for users
to log in to @product@ but it's not the only way. @product@ allows user accounts to
be imported from and exported to LDAP directories. @product@ can be configured to
use single-sign-on (SSO) solutions. @product@ supports token-based
authentication. This mechanism allows remote web applications to authenticate
to @product@. Please refer to the other articles in this section for more
information. Finally, remember that @product@'s user authentication and remote
application authentication mechanisms are extensible. <!-- Please see @product@'s
[security documentation]() (not yet written) for developers for further
information. -->
