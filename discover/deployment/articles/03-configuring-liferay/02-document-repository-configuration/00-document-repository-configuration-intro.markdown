# Document Repository Configuration [](id=document-repository-configuration)

You can configure file storage in several ways. Each option is a *store* which
can be configured through the `portal-ext.properties` file by setting the
[`dl.store.impl=`
property](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html#Document%20Library%20Service). 

The default store is called Simple File Store. It stores documents and media
files on a file system (local or mounted). The store's default root folder is
`[Liferay Home]/data/document_library`. You can specify a different root
directory from within 
[System Settings](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/system-settings). 
To access System Settings, open the *Menu*
(![Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)) and navigate to *Control Panel &rarr;
Configuration &rarr; System Settings*. From System Settings, navigate to
*Platform* and then search for and click *File Storage*
(![Folder](../../../images/icon-folder.png)). For the store's *Root directory*
value, specify a path relative to 
[Liferay Home](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-liferay#liferay-home)
or an absolute path; then click the *Save* button. The document library store
switches immediately to the new folder.

**Note:** To propagate store configuration in a cluster, export your store 
settings from your store's *File Storage* screen in System Settings to a
`.config` file and copy the file to the `[Liferay-Home]/osgi/config` folder in
each node. To export the configuration, select *Export* from the options icon
![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png).

You can also use an entirely different method for storing documents and media
files:

**Simple File System Store**: uses the file system (local or a mounted share) to
store files.

**Advanced File System Store**: in addition to using the file system (local or a
mounted share) to store files, Advanced File System Store nests the files into
folders by version, for faster performance and to store more files.

**S3 Store (Amazon Simple Storage)**: uses Amazon's cloud-based storage 
solution. 

**CMIS Store (Content Management Interoperability Services)**: connects to
a CMIS-compliant server to store files. 

**DBStore (Database Storage)**: stores the files in the database. DBStore's file
(stored as a blob) size is 1 gigabyte. To store files larger than 1 gigabyte,
use Simple File System Store or Advanced File System Store. 

These articles explain details for each one.
