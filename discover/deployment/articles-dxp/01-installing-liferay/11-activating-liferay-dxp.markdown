# Activating Liferay DXP [](id=activating-liferay-dxp)

Liferay now offers a new way of registering its products. Beginning with 
@product-ver@, *Liferay Connected Services* (LCS for short) manages activation 
keys. LCS is a set of tools and services that lets administrators manage and 
monitor their @product@ instances. LCS can install fix packs, monitor each 
@product@ instance's performance, activate each @product@ instance, and help 
manage @product@ subscriptions automatically. To start using @product@, each 
instance must be associated with the subscriptions on LCS. For instructions on 
activating your @product@ instance,
