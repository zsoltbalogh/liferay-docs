# Activating Your @product@ Server with LCS [](id=registering-your-dxp-server-with-lcs)

Once you've addressed any 
[required configuration steps](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/lcs-preconfiguration) 
and deployed the LCS client app, you're ready to activate your @product@ server 
with LCS. You'll use an 
[LCS environment token](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens) 
to do this: 

1. Log in to 
   [lcs.liferay.com](https://lcs.liferay.com). This takes you to your company's 
   LCS project. If your company has multiple projects, select the one you want 
   to activate this server under from the user menu at the top right.

    ![Figure 1: Your company's LCS projects are shown under *Manage Projects* in your user menu.](../../images-dxp/lcs-user-menu-manage-projects.png)

2. Ensure that an environment exists to activate your server under. If you have 
   sufficient permissions in your company's project, you can create a new 
   environment by selecting the *Add Environment* tab. Note that you must 
   activate a clustered server in a clustered environment. LCS environments can 
   only be designated as clustered when they are created. To create a clustered 
   environment, click *Add Environment* and select the *Cluster* checkbox when 
   filling out the environment's information. Note that you must set the portal 
   property `cluster.link.enabled` to `true` in any servers that connect to a 
   clustered environment. 

    ![Figure 2: You must activate your @product@ server in an LCS environment. The red box in this screenshot highlights an environment.](../../images-dxp/lcs-registration-select-environment.png)

3. Select the *Subscriptions* tab, and check the *Assign Subscription Type* 
   table to ensure that the environment you want to activate your server in has 
   a subscription type. If the environment doesn't have a subscription type, you 
   can assign it one by selecting the *No Subscriptions* link and then choosing 
   a subscription type. You should **use caution** when setting an environment's 
   subscription type. All the servers in an environment **must be shut down** to 
   assign that environment's subscription type. Also, **once set, you can't 
   change an environment's subscription type**.

   for more information on using subscriptions in LCS.

4. Select the environment you want to activate the server under, and then select 
   the *Registration* tab. This tab is where you can download and manage the 
   environment's token. In the Registration tab's *Services* section, first 
   select the LCS services that you want to use with all @product@ servers that 
   connect to this environment. All services are selected by default. Your 
   selections of LCS services here are embedded in the token file. 

    ![Figure 4: An environment's Registration tab lets you manage the token file used to connect @product@ instances to the environment.](../../images-dxp/lcs-registration.png) 

5. Now you must use the Registration tab to generate, regenerate, and/or 
   download the token file. The actions you take here depend on two things: what 
   you did in the previous step and whether the environment has a token file 
   already. Note that if the environment already has a token file, the Generate 
   Token button is replaced by the Download Token button: 

    - **No existing token file:** Generate the token by clicking *Generate 
      Token*. 
    - **Existing token file, and changed selections of LCS services:** 
      Regenerate the token by clicking *Regenerate Token*. Note that if you 
      regenerate the token, all @product@ servers that currently use it will be 
      disconnected from LCS and won't be able to reconnect until receiving the 
      new token. 
    - **Existing token file, and no changes to selections of LCS services:** No 
      token generation or regeneration is required.

    Once you've taken the appropriate action, download the token file by 
    clicking the *Download Token* button at the bottom of the screen. 
    [Click here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens) 
    for more information on environment tokens.

6. Shut down your @product@ instance if it's running. Place the token file in 
   your instance's `[Liferay_Home]/data` folder, and then start the instance. On 
   startup, the LCS client app uses the environment token to activate your 
   @product@ instance in the LCS environment that corresponds to the token. 

7. Celebrate! Your @product@ server is activated and connected to LCS.

**Note:** You may be wondering what happens when your server can't reach LCS. 
Don't worry, this won't cause a rift in the space-time continuum. Because LCS is 
deployed on a global cloud infrastructure set up for automatic failure recovery, 
the potential for non-availability is very low. In the event of an outage, 
however, registered @product@ instances maintain a local copy of their uptime 
information to transmit to LCS when it comes back online. Active @product@ 
subscriptions also have a seven-day grace period to re-establish connectivity 
and remain valid. This is ample time for LCS to come back online. Should an 
extended LCS outage occur, Liferay support can provide temporary subscription 
keys that don't require LCS.

In your @product@ instance, you can view your LCS connection status in the LCS 
client app. Access the client by clicking *Control Panel* &rarr; 
*Configuration* &rarr; *Liferay Connected Services*. Note that you can change 
which LCS services are enabled for your @product@ instance by clicking the 
*Configure Services* link. 

Here's a full description of what a connected LCS client app displays: 

- **Connection Uptime:** The duration of the client's connection with LCS.
- **Last Message Received:** The time the latest message was received from LCS.
- **Services:** The LCS services enabled for this @product@ instance. Note that 
  all @product@ instances that connect to the same LCS environment must use the 
  same set of LCS services. LCS services can't be enabled on an 
  instance-by-instance basis. 
- **Project Home:** This link takes you to this server's LCS project. 
  The project home in LCS is also called the *dashboard*. 
- **Environment:** This link takes you to this server's LCS environment. 
- **Server Dashboard:** This link takes you to the server on LCS.

Awesome! Now you know how to use environment tokens in LCS to activate your 
@product@ server.
