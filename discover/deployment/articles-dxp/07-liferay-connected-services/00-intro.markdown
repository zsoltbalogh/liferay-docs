# Managing @product@ with Liferay Connected Services [](id=managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services)

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of online tools and services that lets 
you manage and monitor your @product@ instances. LCS can automatically install 
the fix packs that you choose, monitor your @product@ instances' performance, 
activate your @product@ instances, and help you manage your @product@ 
subscriptions. In other words, LCS is like a butler for the mansion that is 
@product@. Even better, the features of LCS work regardless of whether your 
@product@ instance is on a single discreet server or distributed across a node. 
It's like having a single butler that can serve several mansions at once! You 
can find more information about LCS on its 
[official product page](http://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-connected-services).
