# Using LCS [](id=using-lcs)

Once your LCS client is connected to LCS, you can get down to the business that 
LCS was designed for--managing and monitoring your @product@ instances. If 
you're not already there, log in with your account on 
[lcs.liferay.com](https://lcs.liferay.com). This is where you'll apply updates, 
view server metrics, manage environments, invite external users to your project, 
and more. 

This article's following sections each detail one or more of the features 
available in LCS: 

- [**What LCS Stores About Your @product@ Servers:**](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#what-lcs-stores-about-your-liferay-servers)
  For LCS to work, the LCS servers must store certain information about your 
  @product@ servers. Sensitive data, however, isn't stored on the LCS servers. 
  Learn exactly what data LCS does and doesn't store. 

- [**Managing Your LCS Projects:**](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#managing-your-lcs-projects)
  Learn how to create and request access to LCS projects, how LCS roles work, 
  and how to manage LCS users. 

- [**Using the Dashboard:**](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-the-dashboard)
  Learn how to manage projects, environments, and servers in LCS. This includes 
  applying fix packs, monitoring server status, viewing server metrics, and 
  more. 

- [**Using Web Notifications:**](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-web-notifications) 
  LCS displays web notifications that you can view by clicking the bell icon 
  next to the user menu in the Dockbar. Learn how to manage these. 

- [**Managing Your LCS Account:**](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#managing-your-lcs-account)
  Learn how to manage your LCS account. This includes configuring LCS to send 
  you notification emails when specific events occur in your LCS projects, and 
  setting general account preferences. 

- [**Managing @product@ Subscriptions:**](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#managing-liferay-dxp-subscriptions)
  Learn how to view and manage your @product@ subscriptions for the servers in 
  your LCS project. 

- [**Using Environment Tokens:**](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens)
  Learn how to use environment tokens to automatically activate your @product@ 
  servers with LCS. 

First, you'll learn what information LCS stores about your @product@ servers.

## What LCS Stores About Your @product@ Servers [](id=what-lcs-stores-about-your-liferay-servers)

At this point, you might be wondering what information about your servers is 
stored on LCS's servers. Great question! To protect your users' privacy, LCS 
only stores system-specific data. LCS doesn't gather or store data on your 
users. To offer the best service possible, LCS stores the following information 
about your servers: 

- Patches installed on each server 
- `portal.properties` (except sensitive data) 
- JVM metrics 
- Portal and portlet metrics 
- Cache and server metrics 

Sensitive data is any key-value pair that contains usernames or passwords. For 
example, LCS doesn't store the following properties because they contain 
sensitive data: 

    omniadmin.users
    ldap.security.credentials.0, ldap.security.credentials.1, ldap.security.credentials.2 ...
    facebook.connect.app.secret
    auth.token.shared.secret
    auth.mac.shared.key
    captcha.engine.recaptcha.key.private
    amazon.secret.access.key
    tunneling.servlet.shared.secret
    microsoft.translator.client.secret
    dl.store.s3.secret.key
    auto.deploy.glassfish.jee.dm.passwd

LCS also doesn't store properties that end in `.password`, besides the following 
non-sensitive properties: 

    portal.jaas.plain.password
    portal.jaas.strict.password
    login.create.account.allow.custom.password

LCS also lets you prevent it from analyzing specific properties of your 
choosing. For more information on this, see 
[the section on using environment tokens](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens). 

Now that you know what information is stored on the LCS servers, you're ready to 
learn how to manage your LCS projects. This includes renaming projects and 
requesting membership to projects you don't administer. You'll also learn how to 
manage the users in your LCS project and assign them to the correct LCS roles. 

## Managing Your LCS Projects [](id=managing-your-lcs-projects)

Each environment and server in LCS is part of an LCS project. LCS provides a 
simple UI for managing these projects. To access this UI, log in to LCS and then 
select *Manage Projects* from your user menu in the Dockbar. The following 
screenshot illustrates this.

![Figure 1: To manage your LCS projects, select *Manage Projects* from the user menu in LCS.](../../images-dxp/lcs-user-menu-manage-projects.png)

The *My Projects* tab is shown first, and shows a table that lists each of your 
LCS projects. This table also lists the administrator's email address for each 
project. If you're the administrator of a project, you can edit its name by 
clicking the blue pencil icon next to it in the table. The following screenshot 
shows the My Projects tab. 

![Figure 2: The My Projects tab lists your LCS projects.](../../images-dxp/lcs-my-projects.png)

The *Unlinked* tab shows your @product@ projects that aren't connected with LCS. 
For example, if you've submitted an app on Liferay Marketplace, then it's a 
@product@ project associated with your Liferay account. A @product@ project is an 
umbrella Liferay concept and can span over many different Liferay products. The 
Unlinked tab gives you the opportunity to connect those projects to LCS. The 
*Pending* tab shows the existing LCS projects you've requested access to. If you 
request access to an LCS project, but the administrator hasn't yet granted your 
request, the project appears in the Pending tab. The *Company* tab shows a table 
with a list of the LCS projects associated with the domain of your email 
address. This is typically the company your email address is associated with. 
For example, if your email address is `joebloggs@janesblogfactory.com`, the 
Company tab presents you with a list of existing LCS projects registered to 
users with the `@janesblogfactory.com` domain. The table also lists the 
administrator email address and a *Request Access* link for each project. This 
lets you quickly and easily join the LCS projects that are associated with your 
company. The following screenshot shows the Company tab (the administrator email 
addresses have been masked).

![Figure 3: The Company tab lets you find other LCS projects associated with the domain of your email address.](../../images-dxp/lcs-company-projects.png)

So what can an LCS Administrator do? Why did you mask out their email addresses 
in the previous screenshots? These are fantastic questions! The LCS 
Administrator role is very powerful (that's why their email addresses are masked 
in the screenshots). LCS Administrators can assign LCS roles to the rest of the 
users in their project. Each LCS user must have an assigned role. The following 
roles are available: 

- **LCS Administrator:** All LCS functionality is available to administrators. 
  This is the only role that can manage the roles of other users. 
- **LCS Environment Manager:** All LCS functionality is available in the scope 
  of an environment, with the exception of managing other users. 
- **LCS Environment Viewer:** Has read-only access in the scope of an 
  environment.

You should note that each of these LCS roles assume that the user already has 
the LCS User role in his or her Liferay.com account. The LCS User role is 
granted automatically the first time the user enters their LCS account. The 
actions that can be performed by each of the LCS roles are detailed in the below
permissions matrix. 

**LCS Permissions Matrix**

Action | &nbsp;LCS Administrator | &nbsp;LCS Environment Manager | &nbsp;LCS Environment Viewer |
------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
Access LCS | true | true | true |
Access Any Environment | true | false | false |
Access a Particular Environment | true | true | true |
Manage Users | true | false | false |
Invite Users to LCS | true | false | false |
Create and Delete Environments | true | false | false |
Edit Any Environment | true | false | false |
Edit a Particular Environment | true | true | false |
Server Registration in Any Environment | true | false | false |
Server Registration in a Particular Environment | true | true | false |
Install Fix Packs in Any Environment | true | false | false |
Install Fix Packs in a Particular Environment | true | true | false |

Now that you know what roles are available in an LCS project, and what they do, 
you're ready to learn how to manage the users in LCS projects.

### Managing LCS Users in Your Project [](id=managing-lcs-users-in-your-project)

The Users section of LCS is where you manage the LCS users that are part of your 
project. It's here that you can grant or revoke LCS roles or invite others that 
aren't yet part of your project. To manage users, first click the *Users* tab 
just below the Dashboard tab on the upper-left of your screen. You're presented 
with a table of the users in your project. To the right of each is the Manage 
button. Clicking *Manage* lets you assign or revoke LCS roles for that user. 

![Figure 4: The Users tab lets you manage the LCS users in your project.](../../images-dxp/lcs-users.png)

To invite external users to your project, click the *Invite* button. Here you
can invite anyone with a valid email address. You can also search for
Liferay.com users to invite. Once you choose some users, the *Role* selection
box lets you preassign LCS roles for when they accept your invitation. You can
also use the Environment selection box to preassign them to an environment in
your project.

![Figure 5: You can invite users to your LCS project and even preassign them roles.](../../images-dxp/lcs-invite-users.png)

To view sent invitations, click the *Invitations* tab. A table displays
invitations, listing invited users' email addresses along with who invited them
and the date that the invitation was sent. The table also shoes the preassigned
LCS role and environment. You can cancel an invitation by clicking *Cancel* in 
the Action column of the invitation. 

![Figure 6: The Invitations tab lets administrators view and cancel invitations.](../../images-dxp/lcs-invitations.png)

Great! Now you know how to manage your LCS projects and the users in them. Now 
it's time to get to the heart of LCS: the Dashboard.

## Using the Dashboard [](id=using-the-dashboard)

The LCS Dashboard lets you view and manage a project's environments and servers. 
If you're not already at the Dashboard, click it near the upper left-hand corner 
of your LCS site. Clicking *Dashboard* takes you to the project view. From 
there, you can get to the environment view and the server view. Each of these 
views gives you a different look into certain aspects of your LCS project. 
You'll start with the project view. 

### Using the Project View [](id=using-the-project-view)

You can get to the project view at any time by clicking the *Dashboard* tab near 
the upper left-hand corner of your LCS site. The project is listed to the right 
of this tab, with a drop-down arrow that lets you switch between projects if you 
have more than one. You can also switch between projects from the user menu at 
the top right of the Dockbar. The project view contains a Status table that 
lists any status messages for each server in your project. For example, a status 
message appears for a server when the server is offline. Status messages also 
appear for servers when fix packs are available, monitoring is unavailable, the 
patching tool is unavailable, or other events occur that relate to LCS. 

![Figure 7: The LCS project view shows an overview of your LCS project.](../../images-dxp/lcs-project-view.png)

LCS lists the environments in your project on the left side of the screen. You 
can also create new environments here by clicking the Add Environment tab. To 
view an environment's settings, click the environment's gear icon. You can also 
get more information about a specific environment by clicking it. This takes you 
to the environment view. Also note that the icon to the left of each environment 
differs depending on the environment's type and status. The icon's color and 
type tells you something about that environment: 

- **Red icon:** Indicates a problem or issue with one or more servers in that 
  environment.
- **Green icon:** Indicates that the servers in that environment are operating 
  properly.
- **Icon with a circle:** Indicates that the servers in that environment are in 
  a cluster.

Note that only clustered environments can contain clustered servers. LCS 
environments can only be designated as clustered when they are created. To 
create a clustered environment, click *Add Environment* and select the *Cluster* 
checkbox when filling out the environment's information. Note that you must set 
the portal property `cluster.link.enabled` to `true` in any servers that connect 
to a clustered environment. 

![Figure 8: The red box in this screenshot highlights the checkbox you must select to create a clustered environment.](../../images-dxp/lcs-new-clustered-environment.png)

Next, you'll learn to use the environment view.

### Using the Environment View [](id=using-the-environment-view)

Clicking an environment on the left-hand side of the project view takes you to 
the environment view. The environment view lets you manage an environment in 
your LCS project. 

The UI is segmented into three tabs: 

1. **Fix Packs:** lets you view and apply fix packs for the environment's 
   servers. This tab only appears if a server is registered in the environment. 
   A table displays each fix pack's status, server, and server location. If the 
   server is running, the table also contains *Size* and *Download* columns. You 
   can download a fix pack by clicking its *Download* icon in that column. You 
   can download several fix packs at once by checking the checkbox to the left 
   of each and clicking the *Download* button that appears above the table. Once 
   a fix pack downloads, LCS prompts you to restart your server. Restarting your 
   server installs any downloaded fix packs. Note that you must start your 
   server with the privileges required to write to the disk location where 
   patches are stored and processed (the `patching-tool` folder). To use LCS to 
   install fix packs across a cluster, follow the same procedure. LCS downloads 
   and installs fix packs simultaneously across all nodes--you don't have to 
   handle each separately. 

2. **Registration:** lets you generate and download *environment tokens* that 
   connect your servers to LCS. You can also assign the environment to a 
   subscription type if you haven't done so yet. For instructions on this, see 
   the following sections:

    - [Managing @product@ Subscriptions](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#managing-liferay-dxp-subscriptions)
    - [Using Environment Tokens](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens)

3. **Environment Settings:** lets you change the environment's name, location, 
   and description. You can also see if the environment is part of a cluster, 
   and view or set the environment's subscription type. Click the *Save* button 
   to save any changes you make in the Environment Settings tab. You can also 
   delete the environment by clicking *Delete Environment*, next to the Save 
   button. 

![Figure 9: The LCS environment view shows an overview of an LCS environment.](../../images-dxp/lcs-environment-view.png)

Regardless of the tab you're in, the left side of the screen displays a list of 
the environment's servers. To view a server's settings, click the server's gear 
icon. Clicking on a server takes you to its server view. 

### Using the Server View [](id=using-the-server-view)

The server view provides detailed information about a server, including 
statistics and performance metrics. To protect your users' privacy, LCS doesn't 
gather, store, or analyze user data. You can get to the server view by clicking 
a server in the environment view or by clicking a server in the Fix Packs table. 
Server view is segmented into five tabs: 

- **Page Analytics:** Displays metrics on page views and load times.
- **Snapshot Metrics:** Displays application, JVM, and server metrics.
- **Fix Packs:** Displays the server's fix packs.
- **Portal Properties:** Displays your portal's properties and their settings.
- **Details:** Displays general information about your @product@ installation, 
  Java version, and hardware.
- **Server Settings:** View or change your server's name, location, and 
  description. You can also unregister the server from LCS. 

Page Analytics is displayed by default when you enter server view. Page 
Analytics shows page views and load times for the selected site and time period. 
By default, all sites are selected. You can select a specific site from the 
*Site* selector menu. You can also select a different time period in the 
*Period* and *Ending At* fields. The arrows next to the *Ending At* field move 
the selected time period up or down, respectively, by one period. For example, 
if you select *One Hour* in the *Period* field, then pressing the right arrow 
next to *Ending At* moves the selected time period up by one hour. Note that at 
the beginning of the current time period, it can take up to 15 minutes for data 
to become available. 

By default, load times and page views for all pages are plotted against time in 
separate graphs. Below these graphs, a table displays summary statistics of 
these data over the same time period, for each page. If you click a page in the 
table, the graphs change to plot the data for just that page. If you can't 
find the page you're looking for, you can search for it in the *Search* box at 
the top of the table. To plot data for all pages again, click the *All Pages* 
row at the bottom of the table. 

Load times are also color coded to indicate speed. The *Load Times* graph's 
background is red for values above 3,000 ms, orange for values from 2,000 to 
3,000 ms, and green for values less than 2,000 ms. Likewise, the table displays 
all load times greater than 3,000 ms in red text. 

![Figure 10: The Page Analytics interface in the LCS Server view.](../../images-dxp/lcs-page-analytics-01.png)

To view other metrics and statistics of your server's performance, click the 
*Snapshot Metrics* tab near the top of the page. These metrics are broken down 
into three main categories: *Application*, *JVM*, and *Server*. Application is 
selected by default when you click the Snapshot Metrics button. 

The Application category also has three other categories: *Pages*, *Portlets*, 
and *Cache*. Pages lists the frequency that specific pages load, along with 
their average load time. Portlets lists the same statistics, but for specific 
portlets in your server. The Cache category lists Liferay Single VM metrics and 
Hibernate metrics. The following screenshot shows the statistics in the Portlets 
category.

![Figure 11: The LCS application metrics show portlet performance statistics, like frequency of use and average load time.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-metrics-application-portlets.png)

The JVM category, as its name indicates, shows statistics about the JVM running 
on your server. This includes data on the garbage collector and memory. The 
number of runs, total time, and average time are listed for each garbage 
collector item. The memory metrics are presented in a bar chart that shows the 
usage of the PS Survivor Space, PS Old Gen, PS Eden Space, Code Cache, and PS 
Perm Gen.

![Figure 12: The LCS JVM metrics show performance data for memory and the garbage collector.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-metrics-jvm.png)

Server is the third category in Snapshot Metrics. The Server category shows 
additional information about how your server is running. For example, a 
horizontal bar graph shows the number of current threads running on your server. 
Similarly, horizontal bar graphs are used to represent the JDBC connection 
pools. 

![Figure 13: The LCS server metrics show current threads and JDBC connection pools.](../../images-dxp/lcs-metrics-server.png)

To view your server's fix packs, click the Fix Packs tab near the top of the 
page. The fix packs here are shown in separate tables for those available for 
installation, and those already installed. The Available fix packs table 
functions exactly like the Fix Packs table in environment view for downloading 
and installing fix packs. 

![Figure 14: The Fix Packs tab displays your server's fix packs and alerts.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-fix-packs.png)

LCS also lets you view your portal's property values. To do so, click the 
*Portal Properties* tab near the top of the page. Your portal's properties and 
their values are shown in a searchable table. This gives you a convenient 
display for seeing exactly what your portal properties are set to. The 
properties in this table are organized into the following categories: 

- **Default Values:** The default values for your portal's properties. 

- **Custom Values:** Any custom values you've set for your portal's properties. 
  This includes any property values you change via a `portal-ext.properties` 
  file.

- **Dynamic Properties:** Any property values set at runtime. For example, the 
  [Liferay Home](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-liferay-portal#liferay-home) 
  folder's location depends on your configuration. To always specify this folder 
  when setting any properties that require it, you can use `${liferay.home}` 
  instead of an absolute directory path. 

You can display any combination of these categories by selecting the 
corresponding checkboxes from the gear icon next to the search box at the 
top-right of the table. For example, by checking the *Show Default Values* and 
*Show Custom Values* checkboxes, the table shows your portal's default and 
custom property values. To show only the custom values, check only the checkbox 
for *Show Custom Values*. 

![Figure 15: Click the gear icon to select the type of portal properties to show in the table.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-portal-properties.png)

To view general information about your @product@ installation, click the *Details* 
tab near the top of the screen. There are three tabs under Details: *Software*, 
*Java*, and *Hardware*. Each shows information, respectively, about your @product@ 
installation, Java installation, and hardware. This information is useful to the 
Liferay support team in the event that you need their assistance. 

![Figure 16: Clicking the Details button shows information about your @product@ installation's software and hardware.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-details.png)

Lastly, click the *Server Settings* tab near the top of the screen to view and 
edit your server's name, location, and description. You can also use the Server 
Settings UI unregister your server from LCS. Note that unregistering your server 
doesn't change your actual @product@ server; it just removes it from LCS. 

As you can see, the LCS Dashboard is a powerful tool that greatly simplifies 
the update process and also gives you extensive information on how your servers 
are running. Next, you'll learn how to use LCS web notifications. 

## Using Web Notifications [](id=using-web-notifications)

LCS also displays web notifications that you can view by clicking the bell icon 
next to the user menu in the Dockbar. A red badge on the bell icon shows your 
unread notification count. Here, you can view notifications sent by Liferay 
Support, as well as those generated by LCS. For example, LCS generates 
notifications when a server shuts down or some other event requiring your 
attention occurs. To mark a notification as read, click the small *x* icon next 
to it. To mark all notifications as read, click the *Mark All as Read* button. 
After marking one or more notifications as read, an *Undo* button appears. Click 
*Undo* to mark the notification as unread. To see your notification history, 
select *My Account* from your user menu in the Dockbar, and then select the 
*Notification History* tab. 

![Figure 17: LCS sends you web notifications that you can view by clicking the bell icon next to the user menu in the Dockbar.](../../images-dxp/lcs-user-web-notifications.png)

Next, you'll learn how to manage your LCS account. 

## Managing Your LCS Account [](id=managing-your-lcs-account)

To manage your LCS account, select *My Account* from the user menu in the 
Dockbar. This takes you to a UI that contains the *Email Notifications*, 
*Notification History*, and *Preferences* tabs. The Email Notifications tab is 
selected by default. You can use this tab to configure LCS to send you 
notification emails when specific events occur in your projects. LCS 
notifications are configured by adding *rules*. The rules define what events 
trigger a notification. There are no notification rules by default. Click the 
*Add Rule* button to define one. 

![Figure 18: You can add rules to determine the events that trigger notifications.](../../images-dxp/lcs-add-notification-rule.png)

First specify the project, environment, and server for the notification. Note 
that you have the option of selecting all environments and servers in a
project. Then check the checkbox for each event that you want to trigger an 
email notification. For example, if you create a notification rule with *The 
server unexpectedly shuts down* selected for all servers and environments in 
your project, then LCS sends you an email when any server in your project goes 
offline without a normal shut down event. Click *Save* when you're done defining 
the notification rule. It then appears in a table along with any other existing 
rules. Each has an Actions button that lets you edit or delete it. 

To view your web notification history, select the *Notification History* tab. 
Your web notifications appear in a searchable table. You can also select the 
date range to display notifications from. 

To manage your LCS account's general preferences, click the *Preferences* tab 
near the top of the UI. This tab lets you change your account's language, time 
zone, and default LCS project. Your default LCS project is the one shown each 
time you log in to LCS. 

![Figure 19: You can change your LCS account's language, time zone, and default LCS project.](../../images-dxp/lcs-account-preferences.png)

Great! Now you know how to manage your LCS account. Next, you'll learn how to 
use LCS to work with your @product@ subscriptions. 

## Managing @product@ Subscriptions [](id=managing-liferay-dxp-subscriptions)

LCS also lets you use and view your @product@ subscriptions. By assigning an 
environment to a subscription type and then registering a @product@ server in that 
environment, your server consumes one activation key from that subscription 
type. You can also view your project's available subscriptions and see how 
they're being used. You can access these features from the *Subscriptions* tab 
on the upper-left of the LCS site. 

![Figure 20: The *Subscriptions* tab in LCS lets you view and manage your @product@ subscriptions.](../../images-dxp/lcs-subscriptions.png)

There are four tables in the Subscriptions tab: 

1. **Assign Subscription Type:** lets you assign a subscription type to an 
   environment. To do so, click the environment's *No Subscriptions* link and 
   then select the subscription type. This table also displays any existing 
   subscription type assignments. 

    +$$$

    **Warning:** You should **use caution** when setting an environment's 
    subscription type. All the servers in an environment **must be shut down** 
    to assign that environment's subscription type. Also, **once set, you can't 
    change an environment's subscription type**. 

    $$$

    Once you've assigned a subscription type to an environment, you must use an 
    *environment token* to activate a @product@ instance in the environment. For 
    instructions on this, see the section 
    [Using Environment Tokens](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens). 

2. **Subscriptions:** shows a list of @product@ subscriptions available for 
   your LCS project. For each subscription, this table shows the following 
   information: 

    - Subscription Type
    - Start Date
    - Expiration Date
    - Support End Date
    - Platform
    - Product
    - Processor Cores Allowed
    - Servers Allowed
    - Servers Used

3. **Subscriptions Summary:** shows how your subscriptions are currently used in 
   your environment. For each subscription type, this table shows the number of 
   servers allowed, used, and available. 

4. **Project Servers:** shows the environment and environment subscription type 
   for each server in your LCS project. 

If any of the information in these tables is missing or incorrect, contact 
Liferay support. 

### Decommissioning Servers [](id=decommissioning-servers)

To decommission a server and free its activation key for reuse, select the 
server's environment on the left and then select the server. In the server's 
*Server Settings* tab, select *Unregister*. Also note that when you shut down a 
server normally, its activation key is immediately freed for reuse. If the 
server crashes or its shutdown is forced (e.g., kill), its activation key is 
freed for reuse within five minutes. 

The next section shows you how to use environment tokens to activate @product@ 
instances with LCS. 

## Using Environment Tokens [](id=using-environment-tokens)

When a subscription type is assigned to an environment, that environment's token 
file lets @product@ instances connect to LCS and consume an activation key from that 
subscription. LCS Administrators and Environment Managers can generate and 
distribute this environment token file. It contains all the information the LCS 
client app needs to connect and activate the @product@ instance with the environment. 
This means that you don't need to enter this information manually whenever you 
want to set up a @product@ instance: simply use the environment token file. 

There are a few things to keep in mind when using environment tokens:

- Each environment can have only one token file. 

- Use caution when distributing the token file, as anyone can use it to connect 
  to your environment and consume an activation key in your subscription. 

- Be careful when regenerating a token file from LCS. When this is done, @product@ 
  instances using the old file are disconnected from LCS and can't reconnect 
  until restarting with the new file. 

- Minimal information (server name, location, etc...) is used to activate a @product@ 
  instance with LCS. You can change this information from 
  [the server view in LCS](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-the-server-view) 
  at any time. 

- Since environment tokens connect using OAuth, it's important to note that 
  using an environment token overrides the OAuth authorization cycle. If an LCS 
  Administrator or Environment Manager has never activated @product@ instances 
  with LCS, the first time they do so an OAuth authorization entry is created in 
  LCS. If they've previously activated @product@ instances with LCS, their 
  existing credentials are used when they create a token file. 

So why bother with environment tokens at all? Besides the benefit of simplifying 
the LCS connection process, using environment tokens is valuable in auto-scaling 
environments where algorithms create and destroy servers automatically. In this 
situation, having clients that configure themselves is crucial.

**Note**: If your auto-scaling environment creates new server nodes from a 
@product@ instance in a system image, that instance can't require human 
interaction during setup. When creating such an image, you must change any 
portal property settings that can prevent automatic setup. For example, 
@product@'s setup wizard requires human interaction to set up a @product@ instance. 
You must therefore set the `setup.wizard.enabled` property to `false` if you 
want your auto-scaling environment to create new server nodes from this @product@ 
instance.

To access the UI that lets you generate, regenerate, and download environment 
tokens, select your environment on the left and then select the *Registration* 
tab. This tab contains the following sections: 

- **Requirements:** the basic requirements for using an environment token. 

- **Activation:** tells you that registering a @product@ instance in the environment 
  will consume an activation key from the environment's subscription type. If 
  the environment has no subscription type, an *Assign Subscription Type* link 
  appears instead. 

- **Services:** lets you select the LCS services to use with all @product@ servers 
  that connect to this environment. When you generate or regenerate the 
  environment token file, your selections here are embedded in it. Portal 
  analytics, fix pack management, and portal property analysis are selected by 
  default. Note that although 
  [LCS doesn't access security sensitive properties](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#what-lcs-stores-about-your-liferay-servers), 
  you may have additional properties you want to prevent LCS from analyzing. 
  Enter them into the box that appears when you select *Show Blacklisted 
  Properties*.

Whether you must generate or regenerate a token depends on the actions you took 
in the Services section, and whether there's an existing token in the 
environment. This table summarizes the action you must take: 

Existing Token? | &nbsp;Service Changes | &nbsp;No Service Changes |
:-------------: | :-------------------: | :----------------------: |
 No             | Generate Token (1)    | Generate Token (1)       |
 Yes            | Regenerate Token (2)  | No action required (3)   |

The actions corresponding with the numbers in this table are described here: 

1. If the environment has no token file, then you must generate one regardless 
   of your selections of LCS services. Do so by clicking the *Generate Token* 
   button. Note that this button only appears when the environment has no 
   token. Upon generating a token, the Download Token button replaces the 
   Generate Token button, and the Regenerate Token button appears. 

2. If the environment already has a token, and you made changes to your 
   selections of LCS services, then you must regenerate the token by clicking 
   the *Regenerate Token* button. Note that if you regenerate a token, all @product@ 
   instances in the environment are disconnected from LCS and won't be able to 
   reconnect until receiving the new token. 

3. If the environment already has a token, and you made no changes to your 
   selections of LCS services, then you can simply download and use the existing 
   token. 

To download an environment's token, click the *Download Token* button. Once you 
download the token, follow these steps to use it to connect and activate a 
@product@ instance with LCS: 

1. Ensure that you've deployed the LCS client app, and have configured it 
   properly if you connect from behind a proxy. For instructions on configuring 
   the client app to connect through a proxy, 
   [click here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/preconfiguring-the-lcs-client-to-connect-through-a-proxy). 
   You can download the LCS client app 
   [here in the Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/71774947). 
   For instructions on using Marketplace to download and deploy apps, 
   [click here](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-the-liferay-marketplace). 

2. Shut down your @product@ instance if it's running. 

3. Place the token file in your instance's `[Liferay_Home]/data` folder, and 
   then start the instance. 

On startup, the LCS client app automatically connects your @product@ instance to LCS. 
Upon connection, your @product@ instance activates by consuming an activation key from 
the environment's subscription type. You should see this in your LCS project's 
Subscriptions tab. 

Awesome! Now you know how to use environment tokens to connect and activate your 
@product@ instances with LCS. 

As you've now seen, LCS is a powerful tool that assists you in the management of 
your @product@ servers. In addition to activating your @product@ servers, LCS lets 
you apply fix packs with just a single click and a server restart--a process 
that even works across a cluster. You also get a one stop shop for monitoring 
the performance of your @product@ servers. Metrics like JVM performance, @product@ 
page and portlet load times, and number of current threads give you an inside 
look at how your server is running. What's more is that you can do all this 
collaboratively by inviting others to your project and giving them specific 
roles in LCS.
