# OAuth [](id=oauth)

@product@'s OAuth utility authorizes third-party applications to interact with a
user's resources. It's available as an app from Liferay Marketplace. Let's say
you're hosting @product@ and have users and customers coming to your web
site. You want them to have access to a third party resource, like Twitter, and
be able to access their accounts from your site. In the past, they would have
to provide their Twitter user names and passwords, but not if you use OAuth.
For this reason, a popular characterization for the OAuth client is the "valet
key for your web services."

OAuth is a handshake mechanism where, instead of asking for personal
information, @product@ redirects users to a service provider like Twitter, where
they can tell Twitter to allow @product@ limited access to their accounts. This
example is similar to our earlier "valet key" characterization. You wouldn't
want a valet driver opening your glove box, storage spaces, hood, and other
personal compartments in your vehicle. You would only want the valet to
access what is necessary to park your car. OAuth is based on this same
idea: it gives a site just enough information to do what it needs and nothing
more. This assures users that their personal information is safe, but gives
them freedom to take advantage of valuable resources they typically use from the
service provider's site.

## Registering OAuth Applications [](id=registering-oauth-applications)

The first thing you'll need to do is register an application for OAuth's
services. To access the OAuth Admin page, navigate to the Control Panel, find
*OAuth Admin*, and click on it. The OAuth Admin section will only be available
if you've installed the OAuth app from Liferay Marketplace. In the OAuth Admin
section, select *Add* to create a new OAuth application in the OAuth registry.
You'll be given the following options:

**Application Name:** the display name for your application

**Description:** the short description that is attached to your application

**Website URL:** your application's URL

**Callback URI:** the URI where users are redirected after authentication is
complete

**Access Level:** select the *Read* or *Write* access level. For the *Read*
access level, the user can only view the application's contents, but not modify
them. The *Write* access level gives the user permission to access and modify
the application's contents.

After you're finished registering the OAuth app, click *Actions* &rarr; *View*.
You'll notice @product@ generated two Application Credentials: the *Consumer Key*
and *Consumer Secret*. The consumer key is a value used by the application to
identify itself to the service provider. Likewise, the consumer secret is a
value the application uses to establish ownership of the consumer key.

Take note of your application credentials; you'll need them when configuring
your application with OAuth. To learn how to configure an application with
OAuth, visit the
[Authorizing Access to Services with OAuth (not yet written)]()
tutorial. Once you have your application configured to use OAuth, visit the
next section to begin authorizing requests via OAuth.

## Authorizing Requests via OAuth [](id=authorizing-requests-via-oauth)

Once you have your application configured to use OAuth, you can place your
application on a page and test out the process. Here is a basic synopsis of
what's happening during the authorization process.

The app that you registered in the previous section and configured with the
consumer key and secret by following the developer tutorial is characterized as
a service provider. The service provider uses OAuth to allow users access to
its protected resources. These protected resources are data controlled by the
service provider, which can only be accessed by the application through
authentication. By configuring an application in @product@ to use OAuth, you're
keeping all private information you have between a third-party service provider
and the portal separate. Essentially, OAuth bridges the connection between the
portal and third-party services without the user sharing any protected
resources between them.

Once your OAuth application is placed on a portal page, you'll be asked to
grant or deny the third-party service provider limited access to your portal.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed your OAuth app and authorized
access between a service provider and @product@!
