# Configuring the Patching Tool [](id=configuring-the-patching-tool)

The Patching Tool installs @product@ patches. It ships with prepackaged
@product@ bundles. If any of the following scenarios describes your @product@
installation, however, you must configure the Patching Tool manually:

- Installed @product@ manually on an existing application server
- Customized your @product@ folder structure
- Running in a cluster

If none of the above scenarios describe your installation, you can skip this
section.

If you installed @product@ manually, you must also install the Patching Tool
manually. Download it from the
[Customer Portal](https://web.liferay.com/group/customer/dxp/downloads/7-1/patching-tool).
Unzipping it to your
[Liferay Home](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-liferay-portal#liferay-home)
folder is the easiest way to use it. 

Read on to configure the Patching Tool for your environment.
