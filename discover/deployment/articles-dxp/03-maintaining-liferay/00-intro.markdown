# Maintaining @product@ [](id=maintaining-liferay)

In this section, you'll learn about how to maintain a @product@ installation.
You'll learn how to back up, patch and update your installation. It's generally not much more
complicated to maintain a running @product@ installation than it is to maintain
the application server on which it's running. However, Liferay provides tools
for patching and upgrading @product@ that you should know how to use. It's also
important to follow secure backup procedures to protect your @product@
installation's source code, installed apps, database, and properties files.
