# Countries [](id=countries)

@commerce@ stores a country list that appears wherever a user is prompted to
enter a country (typically to enter a shipping or billing address). Go to *Site
Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click on the *Countries* tab to
view the countries in the system. On this page you can edit the countries in
this list, or---if geopolitical events warrant---add or delete them.

You can also allow shipping and billing for countries you support. Follow these
steps:

1.  To edit a country, click on its name, or else on
    ![Options](../../images/icon-options.png) &rarr; *Edit*.

2.  Check or uncheck the *Billing Allowed* and *Shipping Allowed* boxes.

3.  Click *Save*.

When editing a country you can also change its identifying information (name,
ISO codes), determine whether billing and shipping to that country is permitted,
and select a priority (priority determines where in a menu a country appears.
Lowest numbers come first). You can also deactivate a country by unchecking the
*Active* box. This removes the country from all menus.

## Regions [](id=regions)

You can add regions to countries so users can choose from a menu when entering
an address. By default, regions are already in place for the USA and Italy.
Follow these steps to add a new region:

1.  Click on a country's name and then on the *Regions* sub-tab.

2.  Click ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png), enter a name, an ISO code, and
    priority.

3.  Check the *Active* box and hit *Save*.
