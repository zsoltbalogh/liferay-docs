# Pricing [](id=pricing)

When all you want to do is assign one price to one SKU, you can handle pricing
in the catalog (see 
[SKUs](web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/7-1/skus#pricing)).
If you want to do something a little more sophisticated, use *discounts* and
*price lists*.

A **Price List** changes a product's base price exclusively for members of
a specified user segment.

A **Discount** does not change a product's base price but instead applies
a modifier to it.

Should you use a price list or a discount to adjust your products' prices?

It depends. If you want to offer a special price exclusively to a particular
group of customers, and you want to set the adjusted price for each product
individually, you should use a price list.

If you want to set prices using a currency other than your store's default, or
if you want to increase prices rather than lower them, you should use a price
list.

If you want to apply a blanket modifier to a group of products, however---for
instance, 10% off everything in the catalog, or $10 off everything in
a particular category---you should use a discount. A discount can be applied to
a specific user segment or made available to all customers.

If you want to do these things: 

- limit the number of products that can be bought for the adjusted price 
 
- Make special pricing available to customers who enter a coupon code 

- Make special pricing available to customers who spend or have spent
  a specified amount 

You should use a discount.
