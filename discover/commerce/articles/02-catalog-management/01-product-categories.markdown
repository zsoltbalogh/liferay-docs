# Product Categories [](id=product-categories)

Products can be organized into *Categories*. These groupings allow multiple
products to be handled as a single unit. For example, a product category could
be used to apply discounts or other offers to a set of products, to assist
buyers in finding products, or to promote certain products to a specified user
segment.

To organize products into categories, you must create the categories first and
then assign products to them.

## Creating Categories [](id=creating-categories)

To create vocabularies, categories and subcategories, go to *Site Menu* &rarr;
*Categorization* &rarr; *Categories*. To learn more about the process, go to the
[Defining Categories for Content](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/defining-categories-for-content)
section.

Note: Categories nest hierarchically. While this allows multiple categories to
be grouped together and handled as a single unit, it also makes it difficult for
administrators to see the entire vocabulary. To view all categories at once, go
to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr;
*Assets* and select *Flattened Tree* from the drop-down menu in *Asset
Categories Web*. Then return to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Content* &rarr;
*Categories*.

## Adding and Removing Products from Categories [](id=adding-and-removing-products-from-categories)

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to the catalog, select a product, and open its *Categorization* tab.

2.  Click on the *Select* button under the label for the appropriate vocabulary,
    and in the pop-up that appears the check the box next to each category that
    applies.

3.  Click *Save*.

A product can be removed from a category the same way by unchecking the boxes in
step 2. Alternatively, several products can be removed at once using the category
application:

1.  Find the category you want at *Site Menu* &rarr; *Categorization* &rarr;
    *Categories*. Then click ![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)
    &rarr; *Edit*, and select the *Products* tab.

2.  Check the box next to each product you want to remove from the category.

3.  Click *Remove*.

## Category Display Page [](id=category-display-page)

You may want to associate more than just products with your categories. The
category display page creates a relationship between a category, a specified
page, and a URL for that page. This relationship helps display and organize
content or applications related to that category, as changes made to the
category are reflected on the page automatically. A typical use case uses the
page to display category content for customers.

Follow these steps to create a category display page:

1.  Create a page.

2.  Find the category you want to associate with the page in *Site Menu* &rarr;
    *Categorization* &rarr; *Categories*. Then click
    ![Options](../../images/icon-options.png) &rarr; *Edit*, and select the
    Category Display Page tab. 

3.  Click *Choose* and select the page you just created.

4.  Enter a *Friendly URL*.

5.  Click *Done* to close the pop-up and then click *Save*.

This process creates a relationship between the category and a blank page. At
any point, you can populate the page with whatever content or applications suit
your purposes.

## Images [](id=images)

Uploading images and associating them with product categories lets you
designate a generic category page that automatically displays images and
products for whatever category a buyer wants. These images can be updated by
publishing a new category image. For more details on setting up a generic
category page to display content dynamically, see 
[Category Detail Page](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/displaying-category-pages).

Follow these steps to assign images to a category:

1.  Find the category you want at *Site Menu* &rarr; *Content* &rarr;
    *Categories*. Then click ![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)
    &rarr; *Edit*, and select the *images* tab.

2.  Click on the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button. You can either
    upload an image or choose one from the Documents and Media Repository.

3.  Click *Save*.
