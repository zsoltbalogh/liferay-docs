# Product Types [](id=product-types)

The catalog supports three product types: simple, grouped and virtual.

**Simple Product:** any physical product for which inventory is tracked. Almost
any physical item can be a simple product.

**Grouped Product:** two or more products from the catalog, packaged together to
be sold as a single item. Grouped products are not tracked in
inventory---instead, the catalog tracks all of the products contained in the
group individually. A grouped product can contain simple products, other grouped
products, or virtual products.

**Virtual Products:** A virtual product is any non-physical product. Typically,
a virtual product's inventory is not tracked. This may mean that the product is
downloaded rather than shipped, as in the case of a music file or an electronic
publication. Other virtual products might be services, warranties, or other
goods.

## Creating a Product [](id=creating-a-product)

Follow these steps to create a product:

1.  From the catalog's *Products* tab, click on the
    ![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png) button at the top-right of the screen
    and then select a product type: simple, grouped or virtual.

2.  Next, enter basic product information into the *Add Product* form (see below
    for details).

    Once the *Add Product* form is complete to your satisfaction, click the
    *Publish* button to add the product to the catalog. The product tab bar appears
    at the top of the screen (and can be reached again at any time by navigating to
    the catalog and selecting a product). The first tab, *Details*, is populated
    with your responses from the *Add Product* form.

3.  Enter additional information specific to the product type you selected in
    step 1.

**For a Simple Product**, there is no additional information to enter. When
you create a simple product, the standard product tab bar is displayed,
starting with a *Details* tab where you can edit entries from the *Add
Product* form.

**For a Grouped Product** you must specify the products that it will
contain. A grouped product has an extra tab---*Grouped*---in its product tab
bar. From that tab, click on the ![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png) button
in the upper-right to select any number of products. Once products have been
added to the group, they can be edited individually
(![options](../../../images/icon-options.png) &rarr; *Edit*) to set
a quantity and a priority (priority establishes the order in which items are
displayed---lower numbers come first).

**A Virtual Product** also has an extra tab---*Virtual*---in its product tab
bar. The *Virtual* tab contains the following fields which should be filled
in if applicable:

**URL/Select File**: If your virtual product is stored at a web address, enter
the URL here. Alternatively, click *Select* to upload a local file or select one
that was uploaded previously.

**Activation Status**: Select the stage in the order process at which the
product becomes available for download.

**Duration**: Enter the number of days after purchase in which customers
will have access to the file. A value of 0 sets no limit.

**Max Usages**: Set the number of times a customer can download the file.
A value of 0 sets no limit.

**Sample**: Upload or enter a URL for a sample file to provide to prospective
buyers. The *Use Sample* box must be checked for customers to see the
sample.

**Terms of Use**: Either enter a Terms of Use document directly into the
integrated editor, or select a document previously uploaded to Web
Content.

### Add Product Form [](id=add-product-form)

The *Add Product* form contains the following fields:

**Title**: Name your product. This is the only required field.

**Short Description**: Enter an abstract of the product's full description if
you must display brief version. Text entered here could be displayed where the
product appears in thumbnail form or in search results---anywhere space is
limited.

**Full Description**: This text can appear on the product page. The integrated
text editor provides a number of formatting options that appear when text is
selected, and clicking on the *Add* button that appears when the editor is in
focus provides additional options. For more flexibility, click on the *Code
View* (</>) button on the right to edit the html directly.

**Friendly URL**: This is the URL for the product page. It auto-fills but can be
changed. If you create a product display page (see
[configuration](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/configuration#display-page)),
you establish a relationship between the product, the page, and the URL entered
in this field.

**Meta Title, Meta Keywords, Meta Description**: Descriptors entered in these
fields can help search engines locate your products. 

**Schedule**: Products can be displayed to customers for a preset window of
time. If you don't want to bother with scheduling, make sure the *Never
Expire* box is checked. Unchecking the *Published* box will remove the product
from customers' view.
