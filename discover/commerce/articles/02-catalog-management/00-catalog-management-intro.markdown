# Catalog Management [](id=catalog-management)

The @commerce@ catalog is at the heart of any store site, storing and organizing
its core content. It lists the products the store offers, and stores the
information and relations necessary to organize and display them. The catalog
tracks not only what items are for sale, but also inventory levels, product
variants, and category assignments. It also organizes product files, such as
images and user manuals, and contains pricing information.

To view the catalog, go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog*. Its
contents are displayed under the *Products* tab.
