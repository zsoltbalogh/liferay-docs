# Shipments [](id=shipments)

When a customer places an order, it must be placed into a shipment. An order can
be packaged as a single shipment or broken into multiple shipments (support for
combining multiple orders into a single shipment will be added at a later date).

To view open shipments, go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Shipments*.
To create a new shipment, follow these steps.

1.  Click [Add](../../images/icon-add.png).

2.  Select an order number from the drop-down. Only orders with products that
    haven't been placed in a shipment are displayed. Click *Save*.

3.  A list of all the products in the selected order appears. Choose any or all
    to include in this shipment. Click *Save*.

4.  Enter a carrier name and a tracking number if applicable. Set the shipment's
    status. Enter an estimated shipping date and delivery date, and click
    *Save.*

To split an order into multiple shipments, repeat the above process, selecting
the same order in step 2. Of course, you don't have this option if you selected
all of the order's products in step 3 the first time through.

You can return to a shipment at a later time to add or remove products or to
update its status:

1.  Go to *Site* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Shipments* and select a shipment from
    the list.

2.  To update a shipment's status, make a selection from the *Status* drop-down and
    click *Save*.

3.  To add or remove products from the shipment, click on the *Items* tab. To
    add products, click [Add](../../images/icon-add.png), choose products from
    the list that appears, and click *Save*. To remove a product, click
    [options](../../images/icon-add.png) &rarr; *Delete*.
