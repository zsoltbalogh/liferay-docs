# Customer Portal [](id=customer-portal)

The Beryl Customer Portal is a sample store that models a B2B scenario where
each buyer has an account to conduct transactions. You can use Beryl as
a sandbox to gain familiarity with @commerce@, but it's also a head start on
setting up a fully functional store.

Beryl gives you a working portal with an account management system, a sample
catalog, and working pages for checkout, order processing, and managing
shipments. Other features, such as payment methods, shipping methods, and taxes,
must still be set up manually.
