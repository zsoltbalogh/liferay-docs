# Orders [](id=orders)

The Beryl Customer Portal permits customers to take a hands-on approach to
managing orders. Buyers can create, edit and submit orders, while order managers
can choose to approve, reject or delete them.

## Creating and Editing Orders [](id=creating-and-editing-orders)

A buyer or order manager can place an order by selecting items from the
*Catalog* tab, clicking on the *Cart* button at the top right, and then clicking
*Submit*.

Alternatively, an order can be created from the *Orders* tab by clicking
![Add](../../images/icon-add.png), entering an order number, and clicking *Add
Order*. If more than one order is open, users can select the one they want by
clicking the ![Options](../../images/icon-options.png) button next to the
desired order and selecting *Set as Current.*

## Workflow [](id=workflow)

By enabling workflow, you can require that orders be approved by designated
users before they are placed. Follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click on the
    *Order* tab.

2.  To require that the order be approved before the checkout process can be
    completed, select *Single Approver* from the *Approval Workflow* drop-down.

    To require that the order be approved after the checkout process but before
    fulfillment, select *Single Approver* from the *Transmission Workflow*
    drop-down.

3.  Click *Save*.

By default, both workflows seek approval from Site administrators. To select
order managers or other users to approve orders---or to otherwise customize the
process---see 
[Workflows](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow) for
more detail.
