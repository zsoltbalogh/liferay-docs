# Shipping Methods [](id=shipping-methods)

When buyers place orders, they should be prompted to choose among a variety of
shipping options. You can create as many shipping options as you like, but they
all calculate shipping costs using one of three methods:

**Flat Rate** shipping applies the same price to every product in the catalog.

**Variable Rate** shipping uses a formula to calculate a unique rate for each
order by weight, product price, or other factors.

**Carrier** shipping aligns your shipping processes closely with those of
a shipping company. This can help ensure the prices you charge your customers
closely match your actual shipping costs.

You can create many options for each method, but remember that every shipping
option you create becomes available to ship every product in the catalog.
