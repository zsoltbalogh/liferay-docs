# Flat Rate Shipping [](id=fixed-shipping-method)

Buyers can choose a flat rate shipping option to ship any product. By creating
multiple flat rate options, you can give customers choices of cost, speed, or
security.

Flat rate shipping imposes the same cost on every product in the catalog. You
can create exceptions, however, for individual products from the *Shipping Extra
Price* field in the product's
[Configuration](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/configuration#shipping)
tab.

## Creating a Flat Rate Shipping Option [](id=creating-a-flat-rate-shipping-option)

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click the
    *Shipping Method* tab. Choose the *Flat Rate* method and then the *Shipping
    Options* tab.

2.  Click ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) and fill in the following fields:

    **Name:** Buyers see this name when selecting a shipping option.

    **Description:** Information about the option---delivery time, guarantees,
    insurance and the like---should go in this field.

    **Amount:** Set the method's cost.

    **Priority:** Sets the option display order. Lower numbers come first.

3.  Click *Save*. To create more than one option, repeat steps 2 and 3 as
    needed.

4.  Click the *Details* tab and check the *Active* box. Click *Save*.

The *Details* tab also contains fields for changing the name and description of
the flat rate shipping method. This may be useful for reference, but the text is
not automatically displayed to customers. You can also set a priority that
orders flat rate shipping options relative to options of other methods.
