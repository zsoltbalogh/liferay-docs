# Restrictions [](id=restrictions)

Regardless of your shipping methods, you can apply restrictions. A restriction
disables a shipping method for shipments to selected countries or regions. To
apply a restriction, go to a shipping method and click the *Restrictions* tab.
Then click ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) and select whatever countries or
regions you want to restrict.

You may want to disable a shipping method for certain locations. Follow these
steps to limit a shipping method to specified countries:

1.  From the *Shipping Methods* tab (*Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr;
    *Settings* &rarr; *Shipping Methods*), click on a shipping method and
    then on the *Restrictions* tab.

2.  Click ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) and check the box next to each
    country allowed to ship by this method. Click *Add*.

These restrictions apply to all shipping options for this method, but not to
options of any other method.

To permit shipping to all countries, leave the restriction list empty.
