# Using the Documents and Media Management Bar [](id=using-the-documents-and-media-management-bar)

The Documents and Media *Management Bar* is where people that manage documents 
go to unwind after a long day at work. Just kidding. The Management Bar, as its 
name implies, contains tools for managing the files and folders in your 
Document Library. It appears above the files and folders in Documents and Media. 

![Figure 1: The Management Bar is a great place to hang out if you're managing documents.](../../../../images/dm-management-bar.png)

If you've added files or folders to your Document Library, then you're already 
familiar with the Management Bar's *Add* button 
(![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)). The sections that follow describe the 
rest of the Management Bar.

**Note:** If a Document Library contains more items than it can display at once, 
you can use the navigation tool that appears at the bottom of the window to 
switch your view to another page or configure the page to display more items
per page.

## View Types [](id=view-types)

The *View Types* button is to the left of the Add button. It lets you choose how 
to display the Document Library's items. The View Types button's icon depends on 
the selected view type: 

-   **Cards** (![Cards](../../../../images/icon-view-type-cards.png)): Shows a 
    card-like rendering of the item. If the item isn't an image, a generic image 
    for the item's type is displayed. For files, each card also contains the 
    file's suffix (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.), timestamp, name, and 
    [workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow) 
    status (e.g., Approved, Draft, etc.). 

-   **List** (![List](../../../../images/icon-view-type-list.png)): 
    Shows the same information as the Cards view type, in a list with small file 
    renderings. 

-   **Table** (![Table](../../../../images/icon-view-type-table.png)): Shows the 
    same information as the other view types, in a list with no file renderings. 
    Also, the file information is in columns. 

The items in all view types have an Actions menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)). These actions are also
available in when viewing each item separately.

## The Info Panel [](id=the-info-panel)

To display an info panel with the current folder's details, click the 
*Information* icon
(![**i**](../../../../images/icon-information-dm.png)). The info panel slides 
out from the right side of the screen and contains the folder's name and number 
of items. It also has these buttons: 

-   **Subscribe** (![Subscribe](../../../../images/icon-star.png)): Get 
    notifications about files added to or modified in the folder. 
-   **Actions** (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)): Lists actions 
    you can perform on the current folder. 

## Finding and Arranging Items [](id=finding-and-arranging-items)

The Management Bar also contains tools that help you locate and arrange items in 
the Document Library. The most prominent of these tools is the *Search* bar, where 
you can find files by keywords. 

To the left of the Search bar, the Sort button 
(![Sort](../../../../images/icon-sort.png)) arranges items in ascending 
or descending order. 

You can also arrange items via the *Filter and Order* selector using these
criteria: 

-   **All:** Shows all of the current folder's immediate subfolders and files 
    (default).
-   **Recent:** Shows the most recently modified files.
-   **Mine:** Shows all the current user's files (no matter their folder).
-   **Document Types:** Shows the files of the selected document type. Upon 
    choosing this option, you must select the document type you want from a 
    popup. 

You can also select from the following criteria for ordering items: 

-   Size
-   Downloads
-   Modified Date (default)
-   Create Date
-   Title

## Selecting Items [](id=selecting-items)

The checkbox on the left-most side of the Management Bar selects all currently 
displayed items. Selecting multiple items lets you act on all of them at once. 
You can also select multiple items individually by using the checkboxes for 
each. When you select one or more items, the Management Bar changes to reflect 
the actions you can take on the selected items. 

![Figure 3: With items selected, the Management Bar changes.](../../../../images/dm-management-bar-actions.png)

Here are the actions you can take on the selected items:

-   Download (![Download](../../../../images/icon-download.png))
-   Checkin (![Checkin](../../../../images/icon-checkin.png))
-   Checkout (![Checkout](../../../../images/icon-checkout.png))
-   Move (![Move](../../../../images/icon-move.png))
-   Move to Recycle Bin (![Delete](../../../../images/icon-trash.png))

File checkout and checkin is explained in 
[Checking out and Editing Files](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/checking-out-and-editing-files).
