# Creating Folders [](id=creating-folders)

You'll need folders to organize all but the most limited set of files. Here,
you'll learn how to work with folders in a Document Library: 

-   [Adding a Folder](#adding-a-folder)
-   [Document Type Restrictions and Workflow](#document-type-restrictions-and-workflow)
-   [Setting Folder Permissions](#setting-folder-permissions)

## Adding a Folder [](id=adding-a-folder)

Follow these steps to add a folder: 

1.  Open the *Menu* (![Product Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)), click 
    on your site's name, and navigate to *Content &rarr; Documents and Media* 
    for your site. The Documents and Media screen appears and displays the 
    Documents and Media library's *Home* (its root folder). 

2.  Click the *Add* icon (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) and select 
    *Folder*. The New Folder form appears. 

3.  In the New Folder form, name and describe your folder. Then expand the 
    *Permissions* section.

4.  In the Permissions section, set the folder's permissions. The *Viewable by*
    menu lets you select who has View permission for the folder:

    -   Anyone (the Guest role; this is the default option)
    -   Site Members
    -   Owner

    Click the *More Options* link to choose the other folder permissions for the
    Guest and Site Member roles. By default, site members can add files,
    subfolders, shortcuts, and subscribe to changes to the folder's files.
    Guests don't have any such permissions, which is typically what you want.

5.  To finish creating the folder, click *Save* after making your selections in 
    the Permissions section. 

Upon creating the folder, it appears in your Document Library. Opening the 
folder's *Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) presents several options for 
managing the folder. The following sections describe some of these options.

## Document Type Restrictions and Workflow [](id=document-type-restrictions-and-workflow)

After creating a folder, you can restrict what document types are allowed in it. 
You can also choose what 
[workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow) 
(if any) to use for approving files added to or edited in the folder. 

Follow these steps to change a folder's document type restrictions and workflow: 

1.  Click the folder's *Actions* menu 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Edit*. 

2.  Expand the *Document Type Restrictions and Workflow* section. In this 
    section, choose from the following options:

    -   Use Document Type Restrictions and Workflow of the Parent Folder (the 
        parent folder)
    -   Define Specific Document Type Restrictions and Workflow for this Folder 
        (the current folder)
    -   Default Workflow for this Folder (the current folder)

3.  Click *Save* when you're finished.

## Setting Folder Permissions [](id=setting-folder-permissions)

When creating a folder, you can set some of its permissions via the new folder
form. Fine tuning a folder's permissions, however, can only be done after
creating the folder. 

Follow these steps to fine tune a folder's permissions: 

1.  Click the folder's *Actions* menu 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Permissions*. 
    The Permissions window appears. 

2.  In the Permissions window, set the permissions you want to use for this
    folder. The permissions listed below are available for each role.

3.  Click *Save* when you're finished setting permissions. 

**Access**: Access the folder's contents.

**Update**: Edit the folder's attributes and/or move the folder under a 
new parent folder.

**Add Subfolder**: Create folders within the folder.

**Add Shortcut**: Create a shortcut (link) to any file in the folder 
that the role is authorized to view.

**Subscribe**: Receive email notifications when files are added to or 
modified in the folder. Note that you can specify the email sender and 
template from the Documents and Media's *Options* 
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) &rarr; *Configuration* 
menu. 

**Add Document**: Add a new file to the folder. 

**Permissions**: View and modify the folder's permissions.

**Delete**: Move the folder to the Recycle Bin.

**View**: View the folder.
