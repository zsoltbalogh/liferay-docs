# Checking Out and Editing Files [](id=checking-out-and-editing-files)

When you check out a document in the Document Library, only you can make changes 
to it until you check it back in. This prevents conflicting edits on the same 
document by multiple users. When you check out a file, you can download it, 
replace it, move it to another Document Library folder, check it in, or cancel 
the checkout. Checking in a file also increments its version, which lets you 
keep track of changes. 

Unless you're using
[Liferay Sync](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-liferay-sync-on-your-desktop)
or a 
[local drive mapped to the file's WebDAV URL](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/desktop-access-to-documents-and-media), 
follow these steps to edit a Document Library file from your machine: 

1.  Checkout the file by clicking its Actions icon 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Checkout*. Upon 
    checkout, the file's status changes to Draft. 

2.  Download the file by clicking its Actions icon 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Download*. 

3.  Edit the file locally. 

4.  Return to the Documents and Media Library and click the file's Actions icon 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Edit*. The file's 
    edit screen appears. 

5.  From the file's Edit screen, select the edited local file for upload. 

6.  Click *Save and Check In*. In the pop-up that appears, select whether your 
    change is a major or minor version, add any version notes that you need, and 
    click *Save*.

**Note**: If you edit a file without checking it out, the file's edit screen 
displays a toggle for *Customize the Version Number Increment and Describe My 
Changes*. Setting this to *YES* lets you specify the version increment's type 
and description.

Follow these steps to access a file's version history:

1.  Click the file in the Documents and Media Library.

2.  Click the file's *Info* button 
    (![**i**](../../../../images/icon-information.png)) at the top-right of the 
    screen. 

3.  Select *Versions* from the menu currently set to display the file's details. 

Each file version has an Actions menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) that you can use to perform 
the following actions on that file version:

**Download**: Download the selected version of the file to your machine. 

**View**: View the file entry screen for the selected version of the file. 

**Revert**: Restores the selected file version as a new major file version. 

**Delete Version**: Remove the file version from the Document Library. All 
other file versions remain intact.
