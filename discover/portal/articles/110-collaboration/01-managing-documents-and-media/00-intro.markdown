# Managing Documents and Media [](id=managing-documents-and-media)

The Documents and Media library stores files on the server using the same type
of structure that you use to store files locally. It accepts files of any kind,
can serve as a virtual shared drive, and can mount and browse external
repositories. You can organize documents using customizable document types and
metadata sets and display them with automatic document preview generation. Its
companion app, the Media Gallery, displays selected content from the Documents
and Media library. It can render image, audio, and video files. 

Liferay Sync synchronizes Documents and Media folders with local folders on your
devices, both your desktop machines and mobile devices. 

You'll get started with Documents and Media by exploring how to publish files.
