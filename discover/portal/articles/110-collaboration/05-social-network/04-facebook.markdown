# Integrating with Facebook [](id=integrating-with-facebook)

Facebook is currently the number one social network in the world with somewhere
over 1 billion active users. If you're trying to build a community on your site, 
you don't want to neglect a bridge to that many possible users. With that in 
mind, @product@ provides a few easy ways for you to integrate your Site with 
Facebook.

## Facebook Sign On [](id=facebook-sign-on)

Like many websites you may visit, any site running on @product@ can use
Facebook for sign in. This makes it easier for users to sign in to your 
Site, since they don't need to remember another user name and password. See the
[deployment documentation](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/facebook-connect-single-sign-on-authentication) 
for information on using Facebook to sign into @product@. 

## Using Your Widget as Facebook Applications [](id=using-your-widget-as-facebook-applications)

You can add any @product@ widget as an app on Facebook. To do this, you must 
first get a developer key. A link for doing this is provided to you in the 
Facebook tab in any widget's Configuration screen. You must create the app on 
Facebook and get the key and canvas page URL from Facebook. You can then copy 
and paste their values into the Facebook tab. Once you do that, your widget is 
available on Facebook. 

This integration lets you make things like Message Boards, Calendars, Wikis, and 
other content on your website available to a much larger audience (unless you 
already have a billion users on your site, in which case, kudos to you). If 
you're a developer, you can implement your widget on @product@ and then publish 
it to Facebook.
