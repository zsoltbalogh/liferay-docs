# Connecting Users [](id=connecting-users)

By adding the Contacts Center and Activities widgets to users' private 
Dashboards, administrators can let users form social connections. The Contacts 
Center widget lets users form these connection types: 

-   **Connection:** A two-way relationship formed by a user accepting a 
    connection request from another user. The Activities widget on each user's 
    private Dashboard displays the activities of the other user. 
-   **Following:** A one-way relationship in which one user follows another 
    user. The followed user's activities appear in the Activities widget on the 
    follower's private Dashboard. 

To ensure that all users have a page on their private Dashboard that contains 
the Contacts Center and Activities widgets, you can create a user group and then
create a page via a Site Template. For instructions on this, see the 
[user groups documentation](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-groups).
The widgets are in *Add* (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) &rarr; *Widgets*
&rarr; *Social*.

When you select a user in the Contacts Center, these buttons appear across the 
top of the widget: 

**Connect:** Send a connection request to the user. 

**Disconnect:** Disconnect from the user.

**Follow:** Follow the user.

**Unfollow:** Stop following the user.

**Block:** Block the user. Blocking a user only prevents that user from 
following you or adding you as a connection. A blocked user can still send 
messages to and view the public profile information of the blocking user.

**Unblock:** Stop blocking the user.

**vCard:** Export the user's vCard and save it as a VCF file. vCard is a 
file format standard for electronic business cards. 

When you send a connection request, the user is notified and can confirm or
ignore the request.
