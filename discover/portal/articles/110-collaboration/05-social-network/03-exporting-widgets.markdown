## Sharing OpenSocial Gadgets [](id=sharing-opensocial-gadgets)

OpenSocial consists of a set of APIs for social networking. It may be beneficial
for you to share widgets from your server with other sites, such as 
[ighome.com](http://ighome.com) or
[igoogleportal.com](http://igoogleportal.com). 
These sites let users customize their own pages with gadgets. Users can share 
@product@ widgets on any OpenSocial-compatible site. @product@ does this by 
sharing the widget's URL with the OpenSocial platform. This URL is unique to the 
user's specific widget instance. Users can therefore share multiple instances of 
the same widget as different OpenSocial gadgets. 

Follow these steps to share a widget with OpenSocial: 

1.  Add the widget you want to share to a site page. 

2.  Click the widget's *Options* icon 
    (![Options](../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) 
    and select *Configuration*. 

3.  In the *Sharing* tab, open the *OpenSocial Gadget* section. 

4.  Set the selector to *YES* for 
    *Allow users to add [widget name] to an OpenSocial platform*. In the 
    *OpenSocial Gadget URL* field, replace `localhost:8080` with the name of 
    your public domain and port. 

5.  Click *Save*. 

6.  Close the dialog and click the widget's *Options* icon 
    (![Options](../../../images/icon-app-options.png)). 
    There's a new option available named *Add to an OpenSocial Platform*. Select 
    this option to add the widget to a page on an OpenSocial platform.
