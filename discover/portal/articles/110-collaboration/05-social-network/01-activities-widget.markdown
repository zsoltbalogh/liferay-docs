# Using the Activities Widget [](id=using-the-activities-widget)

The core social widget is Activities. It displays information about user
activity on the Site where you added it. User activities tracked include
updates to the Documents and Media library, blog posts, message boards posts,
wiki pages, and bookmarks. @product@ also tracks information about web content
but only displays this information if the logged-in user is a Site
administrator. This widget provides a summary of recent Site activity. You can
use it on a Site's public or private pages to show what Site members have been
up to, or you can use it on the public or private pages of a user's personal
Site. When added to a personal Site, the Activities widget shows the activities 
of only that user. 

Add the Activities widget to a page from the *Add* 
(![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) 
&rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Social* menu.

Note that the widget provides links to the assets listed in the feed. These 
links don't work, however, unless there's a way to display the assets on the 
page. For example, if you click a link to a blog post in the Activities widget, 
that page must have a Blogs widget to display that blog post.
