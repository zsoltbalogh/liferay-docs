# Managing Notifications and Requests [](id=managing-notifications-and-requests)

If you subscribed to a blog or message board, or if someone sent you a
private message, invitation, event reminder, or mentioned you in a post, you
received a notification or request.

The notifications icon on your profile image shows your number of unread
notifications or requests.

![Figure 1: The number of notifications and requests are displayed above your profile image](../../../images/notifications-icon.png)

To access notifications and requests, click the notifications icon on your user
profile image or open the Menu 
(![Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)) 
and select *My Account* &rarr; *Notifications* under your user menu. The 
*Notifications List* tab is selected by default. This is where all your 
notifications appear. Click the *Requests List* tab to view and manage 
your requests.

## Managing Notifications [](id=managing-notifications)

Notifications can pile up after some time, especially if you were away for a few
days. The Management Bar gives you several ways to filter and sort your 
notifications. 

The *Filter and Order* menu gives you the following options for viewing 
notifications:

-   **All:** The default option. Displays both read and unread notifications. 
-   **Unread:** Displays notifications that haven't been marked as read. Unread 
    notifications are indicated with a blue border on the left-hand side of the 
    notification. 
-   **Read:** Displays notifications that have been marked as read. 
-   **Date:** Order notifications by date. 

By default, notifications are listed by date in descending order. To sort 
notifications by ascending order, click the up/down arrow icon in the management 
bar. Clicking the button again reverses the sort. 

Each notification's *Actions* menu 
(![Menu](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) lets you mark the notification as 
read/unread, or delete the notification. 

### Managing Multiple Notifications [](id=managing-multiple-notifications)

You can also manage multiple notifications at once. Select the checkbox next to
notifications you want to manage and choose an option from the Management Bar.
Select the checkbox above the notifications list to select all notifications on
the current page. The Management Bar shows three actions for selected
notifications: 

-   Mark as Read 
    (![Open Envelope](../../../images/icon-envelope-open.png))
-   Mark as Unread 
    (![Closed Envelope](../../../images/icon-envelope-closed.png))
-   Delete 
    (![Delete Button](../../../images/icon-delete.png))

You can also select *Mark all notifications as read* in the Options menu 
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)). Note that this feature is only 
available if at least one notification is unread. Clicking it marks all 
notifications as read, selected or not. 

## Managing Requests [](id=managing-requests)

When you get a request, it appears in the *Requests List* tab. In each request's 
*Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)), you can click *Confirm* to 
accept, *Ignore* to decline, or *Delete* to remove the request.
