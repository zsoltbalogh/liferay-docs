## Incoming/Outgoing Links [](id=incoming-outgoing-links)

The tabs *Incoming Links* and *Outgoing Links* list incoming and outgoing links, 
respectively. These are wiki links to and from the wiki page. You can use this 
tab to examine how this page links to other pages and how other pages link back 
to this page.

attached to a page. Referencing them using the proper WikiCreole syntax renders 
the image inline, which is a nice way to include illustrations in your wiki 
documents.
