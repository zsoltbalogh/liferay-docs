# Inviting Members to Your Site [](id=inviting-members-to-your-site)

The Invite Members widget lets site administrators send invitations to join the 
Site. You can add this widget to a page from the 
menu *Add* 
(![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) 
&rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Collaboration*. Click the button 
*Invite members to this site* to bring up the interface for sending invitations.

Click the plus sign next to a User or click the *Add Email Address* button to 
add a User to the invite list. Users that have already been invited but have not
yet responded appear with a check mark next to their names. You can also invite
Users to the *Site Owner*, *Site Content Reviewer*, and *Site Administrator*
Roles for your site by selecting that Role under the *Invite to Role* heading.
Once you've added all the Users you want to invite and have selected their
Roles, click the *Send Invitations* button to invite them. For more information
on roles, see the 
[Roles and Permissions documentation](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/roles-and-permissions). 

The Site invitation shows up under the *Requests List* tab on the User's 
*Notifications* page. The User can then choose to *Confirm* or *Ignore* the 
invitation.

When Users confirm such invitations, they become Site members assigned to the 
Roles you defined.
