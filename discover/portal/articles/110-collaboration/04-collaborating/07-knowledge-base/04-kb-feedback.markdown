Each suggestion provides the link to the associated article, the user's 
feedback, the user's name, the feedback's time stamp, and the status on 
addressing the suggestion. You can use each entry's Actions menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
to move the entry between the *New*, *In Progress*, and *Resolved* states.

**Note:** To view article suggestions, your Role must have the permission 
*Knowledge Base* &rarr; *Knowledge Base: View Suggestions*. 

To move suggestions between the *New*, *In Progress*, and *Resolved* states, 
your Role must have the permission *Knowledge Base* &rarr; *Knowledge Base 
Article: Update*. Roles assigned this permission can also view and update the
state of article suggestions from any of the other Knowledge Base widgets.

When you move the suggestion to a different state, an email is sent notifying
the user of the change. You can view and configure the automated emails from the 
Knowledge Base app's 
*Options*
