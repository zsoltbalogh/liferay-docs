# Other Knowledge Base Widgets [](id=other-knowledge-base-widgets)

There are other Knowledge Base widgets you can add to Site pages besides 
[Knowledge Base Display](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/knowledge-base-display): 

-   **Knowledge Base Article:** Display a single article's content.
-   **Knowledge Base Section:** Publish articles associated with a specific 
    topic (section).
-   **Knowledge Base Search:** Search for articles.

You can add these widgets from *Add* 
(![Add](../../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) 
&rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Content Management*. 

## Knowledge Base Article [](id=knowledge-base-article)

Knowledge Base Article displays a single article's content. It even shows
abstracts of child articles. You can add multiple Knowledge Base Article
instances to a page, and each one can show a different article. 

After adding Knowledge Base Article to a page, follow these steps to configure 
the widget: 

1.  Click *Please configure this portlet to make it visible to all users*. This 
    opens the Configuration dialog. 

2.  In the *Setup* &rarr; *General* tab, click *Select*, choose an article, 
    click *Save*, and close the Configuration dialog. 

You can change your selection from the widget's *Options* 
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) 
&rarr; *Configuration* menu.

Knowledge Base Article shares the same UI as the Knowledge Base Display to 
display and manage its articles. Refer to the 
[Knowledge Base Display documentation](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/knowledge-base-display) 
for a detailed description of the widget's UI. 

## Knowledge Base Section [](id=knowledge-base-section)

**Note:** as of Knowledge Base 3.0.0, the Knowledge Base Sections widget is 
deprecated and replaced by 
[categories](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/organizing-content-with-tags-and-categories).

The Knowledge Base Section widget lets you publish articles associated with a 
specific topic (section). For example, a news Site might have the sections 
*World*, *Politics*, *Business*, and *Entertainment*. 

![Figure 2: The Knowledge Base Section widget.](../../../../images/kb-section.png)

To use sections, an administrator must first configure the feature in System 
Settings, creating the section names for use in the Knowledge Base Section 
widget. This process is covered in detail in 
[Knowledge Base System Settings](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/knowledge-base-system-settings). 
When creating or editing a Knowledge Base article, authors can then select the 
article's section in the *Configuration* &rarr; *Section* field. 

You can add multiple instances of the Knowledge Base Section widget to a page. 
Each widget can display articles from any number of sections. You can configure 
the widget to display article titles or abstracts. You can also define whether 
to show pagination or section titles. 

Follow these steps to configure an instance of the Knowledge Base Section 
widget:

1.  Select *Configuration* from the Knowledge Base Section widget's *Options* 
    menu (![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)). 
    This opens the widget's Configuration dialog. 

2.  In the Configuration dialog's *Setup* &rarr; *General* tab, select the 
    section or sections that you want to use and click *Save*.
 
3.  Close the Configuration dialog to see the updates.

The matching articles are displayed in the app beneath their section heading. 

## Knowledge Base Search [](id=knowledge-base-search)

**Note:** as of Knowledge Base 3.0.0, the Knowledge Base Search widget is 
deprecated and replaced by Liferay Search.

Even though the Knowledge Base can show the structure of its articles, it may be 
difficult to find exactly what you're looking for by browsing. That's where the 
Knowledge Base Search widget comes in. 

Enter your search term and press the *Search* button. The results are displayed
in a table with the following criteria for each matching article:

-   Title
-   Author
-   Create date
-   Modified date
-   Number of views

You can select the criteria to display in the widget's *Options* 
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) 
*Configuration* dialog.
