## Managing Knowledge Base Articles [](id=managing-knowledge-base-articles)

Each article also has a *priority* value that determines its position in the 
[Knowledge Base Display widget's navigation](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/knowledge-base-display). Each
article's priority value appears beneath the article's title. The Knowledge Base
Display widget's navigation arranges articles in ascending priority. Priority
1 is the highest priority. The higher an article's priority, the higher it
appears in the navigation. Articles are assigned the next lowest priority by
default. This behavior can be changed via 
[Knowledge Base System Settings](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/knowledge-base-system-settings). 

To assign articles a new priority value, follow these steps: 

1.  Select *Move* from the Actions menu 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    next to the article. 

2.  Enter a new priority value for the article. 

3.  Click *Move* to apply the new priority. 

You can also organize articles with folders. Follow these steps to create a 
folder:

1.  Click the Add button
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) 
    and select *Folder*. This opens a form for creating the new folder. 

2.  Enter a name and an optional description. 

    By default, anyone can view the folder. You can manage this setting along 
    with the other permissions in the form's *Permissions* section. 

3.  Click *Save*. The folder is then listed in a table in the Articles tab. 

The text immediately below the *Filter and Order* selector at the top of the 
app shows your position in the folder hierarchy. Click a folder's name in the 
hierarchy to navigate to it. You can also move articles into folders and create 
child articles. Knowledge Base also supports nested folders.

Each folder's Actions menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
lets you perform the following actions on the folder: 

**Edit:** Change the folder's name and description.

**Move:** Relocate the folder under a new parent folder or update its priority. 

**Delete:** Remove the folder and its articles from the Knowledge Base. 

**Permissions:** Grant or revoke the following permissions: add an article to
the folder, add a sub-folder to the folder, delete the folder, move the folder,
set permissions on the folder, edit (update) the folder, and view the folder. 

You can also delete multiple articles or folders at once. To do this, select the 
checkbox for each item that you want to delete and click the *X* button that 
appears in the Management Bar. You can also see the info for selected items by 
clicking the *Info* button 
(![Info](../../../../images/icon-information-dm.png)) 
in the Management Bar.
