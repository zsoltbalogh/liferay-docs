# Using the Knowledge Base [](id=using-the-knowledge-base)

The Knowledge Base app can be used to display professional product documentation
or form complete books or guides. It even lets you import article source files
written in Markdown. It's 
[workflow-enabled](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow), so you
can require articles to be approved before publication. Additionally, you can
create article templates that help users follow a common outline.
