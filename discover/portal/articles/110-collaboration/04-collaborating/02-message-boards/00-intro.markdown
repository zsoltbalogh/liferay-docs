# Creating Forums with Message Boards [](id=creating-forums-with-message-boards)

Although you're likely already familiar with what a modern forum can do, here's
a sampling of what users and administrators can do with @product@'s Message
Boards app. 

Users can: 

-   Start and reply to threads 
-   Mark a thread as a question and select an answer from the replies. 
-   Subscribe to threads 
-   Author posts in BBCode or with the standard WYSIWYG editor 
-   Assign thread priority (e.g., sticky, announcement, etc.)
-   Attach files to a thread
-   Rate a thread (e.g., like/dislike)
-   And more

Administrators can: 

-   Organize threads into categories and subcategories 
-   Scope a message board to a page, a Site, or the entire portal.
-   Publish threads via RSS
-   Rank users by the number of messages they post and assign labels to these 
    rankings (e.g., novice, legend, etc.) 
-   Create and modify thread priorities (e.g., sticky, announcement, etc.) 
-   Configure email notifications for thread activity 
-   And more 

As you can see, there's something for everyone! 

The Message Boards app also integrates with the rest of @product@'s features. 
In many web sites, it's obvious that there's no link between the main Site and 
the message boards. In some cases, users are even required to register twice: 
once for the main Site and once for the message boards. Sometimes it's even 
three times: once for the Site, once for the message boards, and once for the 
shopping cart. By providing a message boards app along with all of the other 
apps and widgets, @product@ provides a unique, integrated approach to building 
Sites. Administrators can concentrate on building their Site while the 
integration work is done for them.
