# Message Board Permissions [](id=message-board-permissions)

Open the Message Boards app in your scope's Site Administration menu, as 
described in 
[the article on creating message boards](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-message-boards). 
Then click the *Options* icon 
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) 
and select the *Home Category Permissions* option. This permissions screen is 
for granting and revoking access to message board functions. 

The permissions enable a Role to perform the following actions: 

**Lock Thread:** Stop any further additions or modifications to a thread's
messages. 

**Subscribe:** Receive notifications on new and modified posts. 

**Reply to Message:** Respond to an existing message. 

**Add File:** Attach a file to a message. 

**Permissions:** View and modify permissions. 

**Add Message:** Post a new thread. 

**View:** View all the contents of message threads. 

**Add Category:** Add a new category to the message board. 

**Update Thread Priority:** Modify a thread's priority. 

**Ban User:** Forbid a user from participating in the message board. 

**Move Thread:** Move a thread to a different category or subcategory. 

Configure the Roles with the permissions you want and *Save* your changes. 

After adding a Message Boards widget to a page, you can access that widget 
instance's general permissions. To do so, select the widget's *Options* menu 
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) and select *Permissions*. 
This permissions screen lets you control access to the widget instance's 
Permissions, Preferences, and Configuration menus.
