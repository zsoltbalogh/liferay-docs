# Using the Message Boards [](id=using-the-message-boards)

You can add a Message Boards widget to a page from the *Add* 
(![Add](../../../../images/icon-control-menu-add.png)) menu's *Collaboration*
section. The Message Boards interface is similar to other message boards 
that populate the Internet. In any case, it can't hurt to explore how to use 
@product@'s Message Boards and discover its features. 

![Figure 1: The Message Boards widget lets you explore its categories, interact with message threads, and post new messages.](../../../../images/message-boards-category-threads.png)

Threads can be viewed many ways. At the top of the widget is a set of tabs: 

-   **Categories:** The message board's categories.
-   **Recent Posts:** Posts from all categories, sorted by date.
-   **My Posts:** The current user's posts. 
-   **My Subscriptions:** Lets users view and manage their thread subscriptions. 
-   **Statistics:** The number of categories, posts, participants, and a list of 
    the top contributors. You can also access this from the same tab in Site 
    Administration's Message Board app. 

You can also use the search bar at the top of the widget to search for threads 
and posts. Although search works on threads and posts within categories, it 
doesn't work on categories themselves. 

## Posting New Threads [](id=posting-new-threads)

Follow these steps to post a new thread: 

1.  Click the Message Boards widget's *New Thread* button. Alternatively, click 
    the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) and select *Thread* in the Message 
    Boards app in Site Administration. Either way, the same *Add Message* form 
    appears. 

    ![Figure 2: The Add Message form lets you create a new thread.](../../../../images/message-boards-add-thread.png)

2.  Give your thread a title in the *Subject* field. 

3.  Create your thread's content in the *Body* field. This field uses the same 
    editor as the Blogs app, except that it uses BBCode instead of HTML. For 
    further instructions, see the documentation on 
    [using the editor](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-blog-entry-editor). 
    Also note that you can 
    [mention](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/mentioning-users) 
    other users by entering the `@` character and their user name. 

4.  If you want to add attachments, open the *Attachments* section and add them 
    via drag and drop or the *Select Files* button. 

5.  If you want to associate a tag with the message, open the *Categorization* 
    section and use the *Select* button to select an existing tag. You can also 
    create a new tag by entering it in the *Tags* field and clicking *Add*. See 
    [the documentation on tags](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/tagging-content) 
    for more information. 

6.  If you want to select an existing asset in the portal (e.g., a media file, 
    blog post, etc.) to relate to your thread, open the *Related Assets* section 
    and use the *Select* button to select that asset. 

7.  Open the *More Settings* section and select the settings you want to use: 

    -   **Mark as a Question:** Whether to mark this thread as a question. This 
        lets you later select a post in the thread as the answer. 
    -   **Anonymous:** Whether this thread is posted anonymously. 
    -   **Subscribe Me:** Receive notifications for activity on the 
        thread. 
    -   **Priority:** The thread's priority in the Message Board. By default, 
        you can choose *Urgent*, *Sticky*, or *Announcement*. Additional 
        priorities can also be 
        [configured](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-message-boards) 
        in the Message Boards app in Site Administration. 
    -   **Allow Pingbacks:** Whether 
        [pingbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback) 
        are allowed for your thread. 

8.  Open the *Permissions* section and set the thread's permissions. Possible 
    values in the *Viewable by* selector are

    -   Anyone (Guest Role)
    -   Site Members
    -   Owner

    You can also click the *More Options* link to select additional permissions: 

    -   **Update:** Edit the thread. 
    -   **Subscribe:** Receive notifications for thread activity. 
    -   **Permissions:** Grant/revoke thread permissions. 
    -   **Delete:** Remove the thread. 
    -   **View:** View the thread. 

    Note that you can revisit the thread's permissions after posting it. To do 
    so, select the thread's Actions menu 
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Permissions*. 

9.  Click *Publish* to publish the thread. Once it's published, it appears 
    along with the other threads in the category. 

## Participating in Message Board Threads [](id=participating-in-message-board-threads)

To find message board threads that interest you, browse a message board's
Categories or Recent Posts tabs. In the Categories tab, you can view a 
category's thread listing by clicking the category's name. Within a category, 
you can subscribe to an RSS feed and/or emails that inform you about activity in 
that category. The Recent Posts tab also lists threads, except they're the 
latest threads across all categories. 

Click a thread to view it. Messages appear in a threaded view so that replies
are aligned under their parent thread. This makes it easy to follow
conversations. Thread replies are indented under their parent thread. 

![Figure 3: A thread's view displays author information and thread content, for the thread and all replies to the thread.](../../../../images/message-boards-participate-in-threads.png)

Subscribing to a thread causes Message Boards to send the user an email whenever
a new message is posted to the thread. If you have enabled the mailing list
feature for the thread's category, users can reply to these messages to post
back to the thread without having to visit your site.

Most threads get more interesting as users reply to them. Follow these steps to 
reply to a message in a thread:

1.  Click the *Reply* button. This opens the quick reply form, which only 
    contains a text field for entering your reply. 

2.  Enter your reply in the text field. To access more options for your reply, 
    click the *Advanced Reply* link. This opens the full editor from the 
    add/edit thread form. 

3.  Click *Publish* to publish your reply. 

In addition to replying to a message, you can rate it or flag it as 
objectionable. A message board moderator can evaluate flagged messages and 
decide how to handle the messages and their authors.
