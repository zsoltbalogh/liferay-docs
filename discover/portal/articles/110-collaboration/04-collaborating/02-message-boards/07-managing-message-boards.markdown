# Managing Message Boards [](id=managing-message-boards)

Message boards can become unwieldy if left unmanaged. The Message Boards in Site 
Administration facilitates day-to-day thread administration. You may wish to 
assign this function to a 
[Role](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/roles-and-permissions) 
that you give to one or more users. This frees you to concentrate on other areas 
of your Site. For example, you can create a Role called 
*Message Board Administrator* scoped to the portal (globally), an Organization,
or a Site. Members of a global Role can administer Message Boards throughout the
portal. Members of an Organization or Site-scoped Role can only administer
Message Boards in that Organization or Site, respectively. 

Follow these steps to create a global Role:

1.  In the Control Panel, select *Users* &rarr; *Roles*. 

2.  Select or create the Role.

3.  Select the Role's *Define Permissions* tab and navigate to 
    *Site Administration* &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Message Boards*. A screen 
    appears that lets you configure Message Board permissions.

4.  Select the permissions you want message board administrators to have, then 
    click *Save*. 

5.  Add users to this Role. 

## Locking Threads [](id=locking-threads)

You may encounter threads that you think should be preserved, but stopped. You
can halt activity on a thread by selecting *Lock* from the thread's *Actions* 
menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)). 

## Moving Threads [](id=moving-threads)

If someone posts a thread to the wrong category, you can move it to the proper 
one. Follow these steps:

1.  Select *Move* from the thread's *Actions* menu 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)). This opens the 
    *Move Thread* form. 

2.  Click the *Select* button and select the new category. 

3.  If you want to add a post explaining the move, select 
    *Add explanation post*. 

4.  Click *Move* to move the thread. 

## Deleting Threads [](id=deleting-threads)

Sometimes users begin discussing topics that are inappropriate or that reveal
confidential information. In this case, administrators can delete the thread 
from the message boards. To do so, select *Move to Recycle Bin* from the 
thread's *Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)). 

## Banning Users [](id=banning-users)

Unfortunately, message board users can be abusive. In this case, you can ban the 
user from the message boards. While viewing any of the user's posts in any 
thread, select the post's *Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Ban this User*. 

To reinstate a banned user, you must use the Message Boards app in Site 
Administration. Navigate to this app and select the *Banned Users* tab. Select 
the user's *Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Unban this User*. 

## Splitting Threads [](id=splitting-threads)

Sometimes a thread goes on for a while and the discussion completely changes
into something else. In this case, you can split the thread where the discussion
diverged and create a whole new thread for the new topic. To split a thread at
a certain post, administrators can select that post's *Actions* menu
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Split Thread*.
This brings up a form that lets you add an explanation post to the split thread.
Click *OK* to split the thread. 

## Editing Posts [](id=editing-posts)

Administrative users can edit anyone's posts, not just their own. Sometimes 
users post links to copyrighted material or unsuitable pictures. By editing
these posts, you can redact information that shouldn't be posted, or remove
content not conforming to your terms of use. You can also update the thread's
priority or mark a reply as an answer to a thread's question. 

To edit a post, select its *Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Edit*. 

## Post Permissions [](id=post-permissions)

Permissions can be set not only on threads, but also on individual posts. You
can choose to limit a particular conversation or post to only a select group of 
users. To do this, select the post's *Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Permissions*. You 
can then choose which Roles have the following permissions: 

-   Delete
-   Permissions
-   Subscribe
-   Update
-   View 

Use this, for example, to let some privileged users post on a certain thread,
while others are only allowed to view it. Other combinations of these
permissions are also possible.
