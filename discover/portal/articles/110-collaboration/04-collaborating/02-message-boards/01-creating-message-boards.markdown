# Creating Message Boards [](id=creating-message-boards)

You can create and manage message boards in the Global, Site, and Page scopes. 
Regardless of scope, you manage a message board via the Site Administration 
menu. The following sections show you how to use this menu to manage message 
boards in each of these scopes. 

## Site-scoped Message Boards [](id=site-scoped-message-boards)

By default, the Message Boards app in Site Administration is scoped to the 
current Site. To administer this message board, open the *Menu* 
(![Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)), expand the menu for your Site, then 
navigate to *Content* &rarr; *Message Boards*. The Message Boards administration 
screen then appears. Note that the options available on this screen are the same 
regardless of scope. The next sections show you how to change scope and then 
access this screen.

## Page-scoped Message Boards [](id=page-scoped-message-boards)

If you need a page-scoped message board, you must add a Message Boards widget to 
that page and then set its scope to the page. Follow these steps: 

1.  Navigate to the page. 

2.  From the *Add* menu 
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add-app.png)), open *Widgets* &rarr; 
    *Collaboration*. 

3.  Drag a *Message Boards* widget onto the page. 

4.  Click the *Options* icon 
    (![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) in the widget's title 
    bar and select *Configuration*.

5.  From the *Scope* menu in the *Scope* tab, select the page's name or 
    *PageName (Create New)* if the page scope doesn't exist yet. 

6.  Click *Save*, and then close the dialog. 

Note that you must still use the Site Administration menu to administer a 
page-scoped Message Boards widget. You do so by setting the Site Administration 
menu's active scope. Follow these steps to do this: 

1.  Open the *Menu*
    (![Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)), expand the menu for your Site, 
    then expand *Content*. 

2.  The current scope appears just below the *Content* heading. *Default Scope* 
    is the current Site. To change this, click the gear icon 
    (![Gear](../../../../images/icon-control-menu-gear.png)) and then select
    your desired scope. This changes the Site Administration menu to reflect
    scope you selected. To work in a page's scope, for example, select that
    page from the gear icon. That page's name then becomes the Site
    Administration menu's title. 

    ![Figure 2: Select the page's scope under the *Content* menu in Site Administration.](../../../../images/mb-site-admin-scope.png)

3.  Select *Message Boards* from the *Content* menu. Any changes you make here 
    apply to the scope that you selected in step 2. 

## Globally-scoped Message Boards [](id=globally-scoped-message-boards)

To manage a message board in the global scope, follow these steps:

1.  Open the *Menu* 
    (![Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)), then click the compass icon 
    (![Compass](../../../../images/icon-compass.png)) on the Site Administration 
    menu. This opens the Select Site dialog. 

2.  Select the *My Sites* tab, then select *Global*. This closes the dialog and 
    changes the Site Administration menu's title to *Global*. 

3.  Select *Message Boards* from the *Content* menu. Any changes you make here 
    apply to the global scope.
