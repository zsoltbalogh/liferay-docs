# Adding Blog Entries [](id=adding-blog-entries)

Each site contains a built-in blog instance, so you can add blog entries to it 
right away. The easiest way to do this is in the Site Administration menu. 
Follow these steps to add a blog entry in Site Administration: 

1.  Click the Menu button 
    (![Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)) to open the product menu. Then
    expand the menu for your site and select *Content* &rarr; *Blogs*. This 
    takes you to the Blogs app for your site. The *Entries* tab is selected by 
    default, which lists the site's blog entries. 

2.  Click the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) to create a new blog entry. This 
    presents the blog entry editor. Note that the same form appears when editing 
    a blog entry.

3.  The first input field, *Drag \& Drop to Upload*, is for optionally adding
    a cover image for your entry. By default, an 
    [Asset Publisher](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/publishing-assets)
    shows this cover image as part of the blog entry's abstract. You can insert 
    any image you like in this field, either via drag and drop or the *Select 
    File* button. The latter lets you choose an existing image in the blog, an
    image from Documents and Media, or an image that you upload from your
    machine. 

    If you select an image from Documents and Media, you can make changes to it
    with the 
    [Image Editor](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/editing-images). 
    Edits you make are applied automatically to a copy of the image, which you
    can then use as your cover photo.

    Upon upload, the image appears in the pane. To center the image, drag it 
    into place. You can also add a caption. If you want to select a different 
    image, click the *Change* icon
    (![Change](../../../../images/icon-change.png)). Clicking the trash 
    can icon removes the image from the blog entry. 

4.  Enter a title for your blog entry. You can also add a subtitle if needed. 

5.  Enter your blog entry's content in the *Content* field. This field is small
    at first, but it expands as you add content. The editor displays the editing
    controls when you need them and hides them from view when you don't. When
    you select text in your blog post, for example, a bar with context-specific
    editing controls appears. This keeps your canvas uncluttered so you can
    focus on writing. You can also add images, videos, and tables in your blog
    entry's content. See 
    [Using the Blog Entry Editor](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-blog-entry-editor)
    for instructions on creating your blog entry's content. 

6.  Expand the *Categorization* panel and associate your blog entry with 
    [tags and/or categories](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/organizing-content-with-tags-and-categories). 
    Although this is optional, it improves search results for blog entries and 
    gives your users more navigation options. For example, you can add the Tags
    Navigation app to another column on your blogs page, which lets users browse 
    blog entries by tag. 

7.  Expand the *Related Assets* panel and choose any other content in your site 
    that you want to associate with this blog entry. Although this is optional, 
    related assets let you tie together content on your site. For example, you 
    might want to write a blog entry about a discussion that happened on the 
    forums. To link those two assets together, select the forum thread under 
    Related Assets. For more information, see the 
    [related assets documentation](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/defining-content-relationships).

8.  Expand the *Configuration* panel if you want to customize your blog entry's 
    URL, abstract, or display date. You can also set whether to allow pingbacks 
    for your blog entry. For the URL, the default selection of *Automatic* 
    generates the URL for you based on the blog entry's title. This URL appears 
    in the *Blog Entry URL* text box. Selecting *Custom* lets you enter your own 
    URL. Note that if you change the blog entry's URL after publishing the 
    entry, the original URL redirects to the new URL. 

    You can also specify the blog entry's abstract. Enter a 400 character 
    text-only abstract, or a custom abstract that contains a thumbnail image and 
    a manually written description. The *Small Image* section lets you add a 
    small image that appears when blog entries are displayed in list view. Below 
    the abstract section, you can set the entry's display date and time. 

    Note that if you're editing an existing blog entry, the *Send Email Entry
    Updated* toggle appears. Setting this to *YES* sends an email to any
    subscribers when the blog entry is updated. You can customize this email
    when 
    [configuring the Blogs app](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-the-blogs-app). 

    Finally, you can allow *pingbacks* for the blog entry. Pingbacks are XML-RPC
    requests that are sent automatically when you link to another site. If you
    link to another site in your blog entry, @product@ sends a pingback to the
    other site to notify that site that you linked to it. Similarly, if someone
    links to your blog entry, @product@ can receive a pingback from that
    site and record the link.

9.  Expand the *Permissions* panel to customize your blog entry's permissions.
    Use the *Viewable by* selector to set who can view the blog entry: 

    -   **Anyone (Guest Role):** Anyone, including guests, can view the entry. 
    -   **Site members:** Only site members can view the entry.
    -   **Owner:** Only the entry's owner can view the entry.

    Click the *More Options* link to bring up a permissions table that lets you 
    grant or revoke the following permissions for guests and site members: 

    -   **Update**: Edit and modify the blog entry.
    -   **Permissions**: View and modify the blog entry's permissions.
    -   **Delete**: Move the blog entry to the 
        [Recycle Bin](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-recycle-bin).
    -   **View**: View the blog entry.
    -   **Update Discussion**: Edit another user's comment on the blog entry.
    -   **Delete Discussion**: Delete any comments on the blog entry.
    -   **Add Discussion**: Comment on the blog entry. 

10. Click *Publish* to publish your blog entry. It now appears in the *Entries* 
    tab.
