# Publishing Blogs [](id=publishing-blogs)

The Blogs app's editor has a complete set of WYSIWYG controls that appear when 
and where you need them. You can also switch to source mode to edit your 
content's HTML code. In source mode, you can work with light text on a dark 
background or dark text on a light background. You can even open a dual-screen 
HTML editor to see your code rendered in real time. 

The Blogs app also contains a powerful set of tools for customizing how your 
blogs appear. For example, display templates like Abstract or Full Content let 
you choose how much of a blog post appears on a page. You can leverage the 
built-in display templates or create your own. You can also add a cover image to
each of your blog entries. Let's face it---you might not be able to judge a book
by its cover, but a blog post with a nice cover image is more likely to draw
readers.
