# Highlighting Recent Bloggers [](id=highlighting-recent-bloggers)

The Recent Bloggers widget lets you highlight the work of your site's most 
recent blog authors. This widget lists each recent author's name, profile 
picture, and number of posts. You can add the Recent Bloggers widget to a page 
from the *Collaboration* category in the *Add* 
(![Add](../../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) &rarr; *Applications* menu. 

To access the widget's configuration options, click *Configuration* from the 
*Options* menu 
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) in the widget's title bar. 
The *Setup* tab appears first: 

-   **Selection Method:** Set how the widget selects blogs authors to highlight. 
    You can choose *Users* or *Scope*. If you select Users, the widget 
    aggregates every recent blogger on your system. To refine the aggregation, 
    you can select an organization by which to filter the users. If you select 
    Scope, the widget aggregates the recent bloggers in the current scope. This 
    limits the entries to members of the site where the widget resides. 

-   **Organization:** The organization whose recent bloggers you want to 
    aggregate. 

-   **Display Style:** Select how the widget displays recent bloggers: 
    *User Name and Image*, or *User*.

-   **Maximum Bloggers to Display:** Select the maximum number of recent 
    bloggers the widget displays. 

Here are descriptions for the other tabs in the widget's configuration: 

-   **Sharing:** Embed the widget instance as a widget on any website, 
    Facebook, Netvibes, or as an OpenSocial Gadget. 

-   **Scope:** Specify the blog instance the widget displays: the current site's 
    blog (default), the global blog, or the page's blog. If the page doesn't
    already have a blog instance, you can select scope option *\[Page Name\]
    \(Create New\)* to create a page-scoped blog instance. 

When you're finished setting the options, click *Save*. Then close the dialog
box.
