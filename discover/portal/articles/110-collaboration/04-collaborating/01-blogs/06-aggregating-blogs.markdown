# Aggregating Blogs [](id=aggregating-blogs)

You can set up a whole web site devoted just to blogging if you wish. The Blogs 
Aggregator lets you publish entries from multiple bloggers on one page, giving 
further visibility to blog entries. You can add it to a page from the 
*Collaboration* category in the *Add* 
(![Add](../../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) &rarr; *Widgets* menu. 

If you click *Configuration* from the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) in the widget's title bar, 
the Blogs Aggregator's configuration page appears. The *Setup* tab contains 
these options: 

-   **Selection Method:** Set how the widget selects blogs for display. You can 
    choose *Users* or *Scope*. If you select Users, the widget aggregates the 
    entries of every blogger on your system. To refine the aggregation, you can 
    select an organization by which to filter the users. If you select Scope, 
    the widget aggregates the entries of users in the current scope. This limits 
    the entries to members of the site where the widget resides.

-   **Organization:** The organization whose blogs you want to aggregate.

-   **Display Style:** Select the overall appearance for blog entries in the 
    widget: *Body and Image*, *Body*, *Abstract* (default), 
    *Abstract without Title*, *Quote*, *Quote without Title*, and *Title*. 

-   **Maximum Items to Display:** The maximum number of entries the widget 
    displays.

-   **Enable RSS Subscription:** Whether to enable an RSS feed of the aggregated 
    entries. This lets users subscribe to an aggregate feed of all your 
    bloggers. Below this option, you can configure how you want to display the 
    RSS feed:

    -   **Maximum Items to Display:** The maximum number of RSS items to 
        display.
    -   **Display Style:** The overall appearance of each entry in the RSS feed: 
        *Abstract*, *Full Content*, or *Title*.
    -   **Format:** The language to use for your RSS feed: *Atom 1.0*, 
        *RSS 1.0*, or *RSS 2.0*. 
    -   **Show Tags:** Whether to display each entry's tags. 

Here are descriptions for the other tabs in the Blogs Aggregator's 
configuration: 

-   **Sharing:** Embed the widget instance as a widget on any website, 
    Facebook, Netvibes, or as an OpenSocial Gadget. 

-   **Scope:** Specify the blog instance the widget displays: the current site's 
    blog (default), the global blog, or the page's blog. If the page doesn't
    already have a blog instance, you can select scope option *\[Page Name\]
    \(Create New\)* to create a page-scoped blog instance. 

When you finish setting the options, click *Save* and then close the dialog box. 
You'll notice that the Blogs Aggregator looks very much like the Blogs widget, 
except that it shows entries from multiple blogs.
