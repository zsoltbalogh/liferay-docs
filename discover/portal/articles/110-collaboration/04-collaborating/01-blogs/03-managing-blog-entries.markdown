# Managing Blog Entries [](id=managing-blog-entries)

The Blogs app in Site Administration helps bloggers and blog administrators 
manage blog entries. To access this app, click the Menu button 
(![Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)) to open the product menu, then 
expand the menu for your site and select *Content* &rarr; *Blogs*. The *Entries* 
tab is selected by default, which lists the site's blog entries.

You can use the Management Bar to manage your site's blog entries. If you've 
added blog entries via your site's Blogs app, then you're already familiar with 
the Management Bar's *Add* button 
(![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)). The sections that follow describe the 
rest of the Management Bar. 

## View Types [](id=view-types)

The *View Types* button is to the left of the Add button. It lets you choose how 
to display the blog entries in the Blogs app. The View Types button's icon 
depends on the selected view type: 

-   **Cards** (![Cards](../../../../images/icon-view-type-cards.png)): Shows a 
    card-like rendering of the blog entry, with the author's profile picture. If 
    the entry doesn't contain a cover image, a generic rendering of the entry is 
    displayed. Each card also contains the entry's timestamp, title, 
    [workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow) 
    status (e.g., Approved, Draft, etc.), and an Actions menu 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)). 

-   **List** (![List](../../../../images/icon-view-type-list.png)): 
    Shows the same information as the Cards view type, in a list with the 
    author's profile picture instead of the blog entry's cover image. 

-   **Table** (![Table](../../../../images/icon-view-type-table.png)): Shows the 
    same information as the other view types, in a list with no file renderings. 
    Also, the blog entry information is in columns. 

## Finding and Arranging Blog Entries [](id=finding-and-arranging-blog-entries)

The Management Bar also contains tools that help you locate and arrange blog 
entries. The most prominent of these tools is the *Search* bar, where you can 
find files by keywords. 

To the left of the Search bar, the Sort button 
(![Sort](../../../../images/icon-sort.png)) arranges entries in ascending 
or descending order. 

You can also arrange entries via the *Filter and Order* selector using these
criteria: 

-   **All:** Shows all of the site's entries. 
-   **Mine:** Shows only the current user's entries. 
-   **Title:** Orders the entries by title. 
-   **Display Date:** Orders the entries by display date. 

## Selecting Blog Entries [](id=selecting-blog-entries)

The checkbox on the left-most side of the Management Bar selects all currently 
displayed blog entries. Selecting multiple entries lets you act on all of them 
at once. You can also select multiple entries individually by using the 
checkboxes for each. When you select one or more entries, the Management Bar 
changes to reflect the actions you can take on the selected entries. 

Click the *Trash* button 
(![Trash](../../../../images/icon-trash.png)) to move the selected entries to 
the Recycle Bin. Click *Deselect all* to deselect all the selected entries and 
return the Management Bar to its normal view.
