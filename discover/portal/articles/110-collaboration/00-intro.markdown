# Collaboration [](id=collaboration)

@product@ contains an expansive collaboration suite that empowers users to 
create content and communities that they couldn't create alone. A robust 
document management system is a key component of this suite. As users produce
digital assets---documents, videos, audio---they can store and share them using
the Documents and Media Library. Documents and Media supports file check in and
check out to prevent conflicting edits from multiple users, and maintains
a version history of those files. It also contains its own repository, and for
added flexibility can connect to external repositories. Once files exist in
Documents and Media, users can insert them in other content like blog posts and
wiki articles. 

The collaboration suite also contains apps that let users share information and 
create active communities. The Message Boards app gives users a platform for 
discussions. The Blogs app lets users publish their ideas using rich content. 
Notifications keep users informed of what's happening. Social networking apps 
let users connect and share in ways that bolster friendship and productivity. 
And this is just scratching the surface---there are many more apps that help 
users communicate, produce, and present. 

The guides that follow show you how to leverage these features, and more, in 
detail.
