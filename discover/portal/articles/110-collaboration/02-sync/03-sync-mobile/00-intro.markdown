# Using Liferay Sync on Your Mobile Device [](id=using-liferay-sync-on-your-mobile-device)

Liferay Sync for Android and iOS contains most of the
[desktop Sync client](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-liferay-sync-on-your-desktop)'s
functionality. The mobile client can, however, only be connected to one 
@product@ account at a time. Also, mobile Sync doesn't automatically download
files to your device. To save storage space on your device, the Sync mobile app
lets you choose the files you want to work with. As with the Sync desktop
clients, the latest versions of Sync on Android and iOS provide a consistent
user experience across platforms. While this article details using Sync on
Android, the instructions also apply to Sync on iOS. 

You need to download and install Sync on your Android or iOS device through its 
respective app store, the same as you do any other mobile app. To find the app, 
search Google Play or the App Store for *Liferay*. You can also download Sync 
from the 
[Liferay Sync downloads page](https://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-sync). 
Once you've installed the Sync app on your device, the rest of the articles in 
this guide show you how to use it.
