# Liferay Sync [](id=liferay-sync)

Liferay Sync synchronizes files between your @product@ server and users' desktop 
and mobile environments. With Liferay Sync, users can publish and access shared 
documents and files from their native environments without using a browser. 
Clients for Windows and Mac OS desktops and Android and iOS mobile platforms are 
supported. As users add and collaborate on documents and files, Liferay Sync
automatically synchronizes them across all configured Sync clients and your
server. Liferay Sync integrates completely with @product@ so that features such
as authentication and versioning function in the supported environments. The
Liferay Sync desktop client stores files locally so they're always available,
even when users are offline. It automatically synchronizes files upon client
reconnection. The Liferay Sync mobile client saves storage space on users'
devices by downloading only the files they choose.
