# Using Liferay Sync on Your Desktop [](id=using-liferay-sync-on-your-desktop)

Liferay Sync synchronizes files between your @product@ Sites and desktop 
devices. It lets you work with your files without using a browser. The Sync 
clients also ensure that the files are updated with the latest changes made by 
other users. To use Liferay Sync in your desktop environment, you must install 
the Sync desktop client. It's currently available for Windows and Mac OS. The 
Sync client stores files locally so that they're always available, even when 
you're offline. Files are automatically synchronized upon your client's
reconnection to your @product@ server. 

On your desktop devices, Liferay Sync creates a new folder structure that it
uses to synchronize files. You can treat the files the same as you do any
others. Credentials, Sync folder location, and other options are configured in
the client. Also, native desktop notification events inform you of what Sync is
doing. The native menu and task bar integration keep Sync controls within easy
reach. 

This guide walks you through setting up and using the Liferay Sync client on
your desktop. Before proceeding, check your @product@ instance or Site
administrator to ensure that Sync is enabled for your Sites.
