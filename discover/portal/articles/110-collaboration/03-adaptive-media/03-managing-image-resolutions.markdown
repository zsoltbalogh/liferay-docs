# Managing Image Resolutions [](id=managing-image-resolutions)

Adaptive Media lets you manage image resolutions and their resulting adapted 
images. For example, you can disable, enable, edit, and delete resolutions. You 
can also generate any adapted images that may be missing for a resolution. This 
article discusses these topics and more. 

## Disabling Image Resolutions [](id=disabling-image-resolutions)

Disabling an image resolution prevents it from generating adapted images. Any 
images uploaded after the resolution is disabled use the most appropriate
resolution that's still active. Adapted images previously generated by the
disabled resolution are still available. 

To disable an image resolution, click its *Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Disable*. 

## Enabling Image Resolutions [](id=enabling-image-resolutions)

Image resolutions are enabled by default. If you need to enable a disabled 
resolution, click that resolution's *Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Enable*. 

While a resolution is disabled, it doesn't generate adapted images for 
new image uploads. After enabling a resolution, you should generate the adapted 
images that weren't generated while it was disabled (see the 
[Generating Missing Image Resolutions](#generating-missing-image-resolutions) 
section for instructions on this). 

## Editing Image Resolutions [](id=editing-image-resolutions)

You can't edit an image resolution that already has adapted images. This 
prevents odd behavior (of the adapted images--you're still free to be as odd as 
you want). This is because any changes would only be applied to images uploaded 
after the edit, creating an inconsistent set of adapted images. Odd indeed.

Therefore, editing an image resolution is only possible if Adaptive Media hasn't
yet generated adapted images for it. If you must change the values of
a resolution that already has adapted images, you must delete that resolution
and create a new one with the new values. The next section discusses deleting
resolutions. 

## Deleting Image Resolutions [](id=deleting-image-resolutions)

Be careful when deleting an image resolution, as any adapted images it created
are irretrievably lost and are not automatically replaced by new image
resolutions you create.

Follow these steps to delete an image resolution:

1.  Disable the resolution. You can't delete enabled resolutions. This prevents 
    the accidental deletion of image resolutions. 

2.  To delete the resolution and all its adapted images, select *Delete* from 
    the resolution's Actions menu 
    (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)). 

## Generating Missing Adapted Images [](id=generating-missing-image-resolutions)

If Adaptive Media hasn't generated all the images you need--say, if new images
were uploaded before a new image resolution was created or while the resolution
was disabled--you must generate the missing images manually.

To manually generate missing adapted images,

1.  For a single resolution, select *Adapt Remaining* from the resolution's 
    Actions menu 
    (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)). 

2.  For all resolutions at once, select *Adapt All Images* from the Actions menu 
    in the Control Menu at the top of the page. 

## The Recycle Bin and Adapted Images [](id=recycling-adapted-images)

You can't move adapted images directly to the Recycle Bin. But if the original 
image is in the Recycle Bin, the corresponding adapted images behave as if they 
are in the Recycle Bin and users can't view them.

**Note:** URLs that point to adapted images whose original image is in the 
Recycle Bin return an error code of `404 Not Found`.

If the original image is restored from the Recycle Bin, the adapted images are 
accessible again.

Awesome! Now you know how to manage image resolutions in Adaptive Media. Next, 
you'll learn about creating content with adapted images.
