# Adapting Your Media Across Multiple Devices [](id=adapting-your-media-across-multiple-devices)

Media providers must consider differences between devices (phones, laptops,
tablets, etc.) when delivering content: not only their screen size but also
their bandwidth and processing capabilities. @product@'s Adaptive Media app
allows administrators to control image quality and dynamically adjusts uploaded
media to best fit the screen being used.

Adaptive Media integrates with Documents and Media, Blogs, and Web Content. It
generates a set of images for use on various screens. When the content is
accessed, Adaptive Media checks the screen type and resolution and selects
appropriate the appropriate image. You can find the Adaptive Media app on
[Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace), for Liferay Portal
CE 7.1 and Liferay DXP 7.1. 

In this section, you'll learn how to manage and use Adaptive Media in @product@.
