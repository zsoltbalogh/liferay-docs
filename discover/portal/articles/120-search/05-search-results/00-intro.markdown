# Search Results [](id=search-results)

The ideal search experience involves a User entering a search term, waiting an
infinitesimal amount of time, and having the perfectly matching asset delivered
at the top of a list of other extremely relevant hits. Like this:

The developers of an asset control much about how the asset's information is
stored in the search engine (this process is called
*indexing*<!--(/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/understanding-search-and-indexing)-->),
and how its information is searched and returned in the search results.
Developers who dislike how a particular asset behaves in search can use an
*Indexer Post Processor* to modify the asset's indexing behavior and how search
queries are constructed to look up the assets in @product@.

The Search Results behavior configurable through the UI is covered in this
section:

- [Search Results Display Settings](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/display-settings)
