# System Wide Settings [](id=system-wide-settings)

It can be hard to keep track of all the configuration interfaces. The Control
Panel's Configuration section houses a lot of the higher level (for example,
system and instance scoped) configuration options. This section considers the
configuration options dealing with the *System* scope. Configuration at the
system level affects all the *Virtual Instances* of Liferay in the system. If
you're not sure what a Virtual Instance is, read the section on
[Setting Up a Liferay Instance](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/setting-up-a-virtual-instance).

There are several Control Panel sections with system scoped configurations:

- System Settings is the primary location for system configuration.

- Server Administration contains some lower-level server configuration options, such
  as logging.
