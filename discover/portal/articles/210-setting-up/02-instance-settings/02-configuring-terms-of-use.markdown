# Terms of Use [](id=terms-of-use)

Terms of Use are important when you need them, but not all Sites do. They're not
first in the Instance Settings interface, but they're one of the first things
to configure for your virtual instance.

Configure Terms of Use for the virtual instance at *Control Panel* &rarr;
*Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings*. In the Configuration tab, scroll
down to the Terms of Use section and expand it.

Since the Terms of Use page is enabled by default, one of your first actions
should be to disable or replace the default, placeholder terms.  You can disable
the requirement for all Users to read the terms of use or set the Group ID and
Article ID for the Web Content Article that contains your Terms of Use.

To find a Web Content Article's ID:

1.  Go to the *Site Menu* &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Web Content*. 

2.  Click on the Terms of Use article. Its ID appears at the top of the screen,
    with the Version and Workflow Status.

The Group ID is the ID of the Site the Web Content is associated with. To find
the Group/Site ID:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Site Settings*.

2.  Find the Site ID field in the General tab. Enter it into the Group ID
    field.

Save the configuration and now all users signing in for the first time see your
Terms of Use article. Users must agree to the Terms of Use to register their
User Accounts.
