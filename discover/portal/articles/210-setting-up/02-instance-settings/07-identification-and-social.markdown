# Identification and Social [](id=identification-and-social)

The Identification and Social sections of Instance Settings are smaller than
some of the other sections, but contain important settings for some virtual
instances. Both are top level tabs of Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr;
Instance Settings.

## Identification [](id=identification)

The Identification section has several links for addresses, phone numbers and
other contact information for the organization that owns the instance.
Developers can query for this information in their applications.

## Social [](id=social)

The Social section configures Ratings and Mentions throughout the instance. For
each portlet with ratings enabled, choose whether to use a simple *Like*,
*Thumbs*, or *Stars* for rating the content. You can also choose whether Users
can mention (*@Username*) other Users, and if so, whether all Users can do that
or you want to further refine the mentions configuration.
