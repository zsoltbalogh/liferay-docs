# User Groups [](id=user-groups)

A user group is a list of users created for a specific purpose. User groups can
also be created across the hierarchical boundaries of
[organizations](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/organizations). For
example, an administrator could create a user group for managing a Site's
message boards and assign users from several organizations to that user group.
User groups are integrated with Roles, Sites, Site Templates, and permissions.
This flexibility means that there are many different use cases for user groups.
The articles in this section show you how to work with user groups to serve the
most common use cases. 

User groups are most often used in these scenarios: 

-   **Manage Site membership:** Grant Site membership to all users in a user 
    group. Using the previous example, the Teachers user group could be added 
    as a member of the Sites *University Employees* and 
    *Students and Teachers Collaboration*. This would add all users in that user 
    group as members of those Sites. 

-   **Manage user personal pages:** Provide predefined public or private pages 
    to the users in the user group. For example, the Teachers user group could 
    be created to ensure the home page on all teachers' personal Sites has the 
    same layout and applications. 

-   **Collect permissions:** Assign Roles and permissions to a group of users 
    that don't share an organization. For example, in a university's portal, a 
    user group could be created to group all teachers independently of their 
    departments (organization). This would make it easier to assign one or 
    several Roles at once to all the teachers.
