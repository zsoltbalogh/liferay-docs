# Editing User Groups [](id=editing-user-groups)

Editing an existing user group is a straightforward process. You can access your 
portal's user groups from *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users* &rarr; *User Groups*, 
which lists user groups in a table. Managing membership is the most common 
action you'll likely perform on a user group.

Follow these steps to add/remove users to/from a user group: 

1.  Click the user group's name or description. Alternatively, you can click the 
    user group's *Actions* button 
    (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    and select *Assign Members*. This presents a list of the user group's users. 

2.  To remove a user from the user group, click the `X` button next to that 
    user. To remove multiple users at once, check each user's checkbox and then 
    click the trash icon 
    (![Trash](../../../images/icon-trash.png)) 
    that appears in the Management Bar above the user list. 

3.  To add users to the user group, click the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)). 
    In the dialog that appears, select the users and click *Add*.

Other options are available in each user group's Actions button 
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)): 

**Edit:** Modify the user group's name or description, or choose Site 
templates to use for the 
[user group's Sites](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-group-sites).

**Permissions:** Assign permissions for viewing and managing the user group. 

**User Group Pages Permissions:** Assign permissions for managing the user 
group's Site pages. 

**Manage Pages:** Manually manage the user group's Site pages. See the 
[documentation on user group Sites](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-group-sites#creating-user-group-sites-manually)
for details. 

**Assign Members:** Add/remove users to/from the user group. This is 
described in detail above. 

**Delete:** Remove the user group. Note that you can't delete a user group 
that contains users. You must first remove the users from the group. 

If your user group has public and private Site pages, the options 
*Go to Profile Pages* and *Go to Dashboard Pages* also appear in your user 
group's Actions menu. Clicking one of these links opens that Site in a new 
browser window. See the 
[documentation on user group Sites](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-group-sites) 
for details.
