# Configuring User Group Permissions [](id=configuring-user-group-permissions)

Administrators commonly create user groups so the group's users can take some
specific action in a Site. This is done by assigning the permissions for that
action to a Role, and then assigning that Role to the user group. This grants
the Role's permissions to the user group's users. 

Follow these steps to grant permissions to users in a user group: 

1.  [Create the user group](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-a-user-group).
2.  [Assign the user group to a Site](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-groups-and-site-membership). 
3.  [Create the Site Role and define its permissions](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/roles-and-permissions). 
4.  Assign the Role to the user group. 

For instructions on the first three steps, click those links above. This article
shows you how to assign a Role to a user group. Follow these steps: 

1.  Open the Menu 
    (![Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)), 
    select the Site to work in, then open its Site Administration menu. 

2.  In the Site Administration menu, select *Members* &rarr; *Site Memberships*. 
    This opens the Site Memberships screen.

    user groups currently assigned to the Site. 

4.  Click the *Actions* button 
    (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    for the user group you want to assign to a Role, and select 
    *Assign Site Roles*. This opens the Assign Site Roles dialog.
