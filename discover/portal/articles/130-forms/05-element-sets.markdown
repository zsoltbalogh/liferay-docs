# Form Element Sets [](id=form-element-sets)

If you're here looking for information on reusable field sets, you're in the
right place. We call them Element Sets in the Liferay Forms application because
these sets include more than just fields: they include the layout and
configuration of the fields as well. In the future, additional styling elements
will be available here, too. 

Element sets are more like composable Form fragments or reusable Form blocks. 

Sometimes you might be able to create an entire form by composing existing
Element Sets. Your colleagues might call you lazy, but we'd call you
industrious.

## Creating Element Sets [](id=creating-element-sets)

To create Element Sets, go to Site Menu &rarr; Content &rarr; Forms. The Forms
view is displayed by default. Click the *Element Sets* tab, and any existing
Element Sets appear, just like existing Forms are displayed in the Forms view.
Click the *Add* button (![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)).

Here's the thing. If you know how to 
[create a Form](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-and-managing-forms), 
you already know how to create an Element Set. The process is identical. Drag
and drop elements onto the form builder palette, configuring fields as you go.

When you're finished, click *Save*. Element Sets aren't publishable, so there's
no button for that.

![Figure 1: Creating Element Sets is just like creating Forms. You just can't publish them.](../../images/forms-element-sets.png)

Once an Element Set is saved, it's instantly available for use, even in the same
Element Set. That's right, you can use Element Sets to create Element Sets.

## Using Element Sets [](id=using-element-sets)

To use an Element Set in a Form:

1.  Open the Form Builder.

2.  If the Add Elements sidebar isn't already displayed, open it by clicking the
    *Add* button (![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)).

3.  The default view in the Add Elements sidebar is Elements. Instead click
    *Element Sets*.

4.  Drag the Element Set onto the Form Builder, just like you would any single
    Form Element.

![Figure 2: Add an Element Set the same way you add other Form Elements, like fields.](../../images/forms-add-element-set.png)

You probably already guessed that the process is identical for using Element
Sets to build other Element Sets. That's all there is to it. There are just a
couple more things to note:

- Once an Element Set is added to a Form, there's no connection with the root
  Element Set. You're free to move or configure the Fields and Elements however
  you want.

- Editing an Element Set doesn't retroactively affect the Forms where the
  Element Set was used. 

Think ahead. Are there some common fields you'll commonly need to configure in
your Forms? If so, create them as Element Sets once and save yourself
repetitive work.
