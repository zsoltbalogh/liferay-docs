# Managing Form Entries [](id=managing-form-entries)

Once users begin submitting form entries, you'll want to do these things with
them:

- View form entries
- Export form entries
- Delete form entries

Start by learning how to access and view the entries.

## Viewing Form Entries [](id=viewing-form-entries)

When users fill out forms, they're generating data. You'll want to see it at
some point. 

1.  From the Menu, navigate back to the *Content* &rarr; *Forms* section of The
    Lunar Resort site.

2.  Click the *Actions* (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) button for
    the form and select *View Entries*.

3.  What if you  have a lot of form fields and you can't see all the data for
    each entry in the search container? Just click the *Actions*
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) button for the entry and select
    *View*. You'll be able to see all the specifics for that form entry.

Viewing entries is great, but this is serious data we're talking about. You
might need to get all the entries into a spreadsheet so you can work with them. 

## Exporting Form Entries [](id=exporting-form-entries)

So you need to put your form entries in a spreadsheet to do spreadhseet things
with them? No problem.

1.  Navigate to the Forms application in The Lunar Resort site's Content section
    again.

2.  Click the *Actions* (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) button and
    select *Export*. 

3.  Choose a File Extension. You can get entries in CSV, XLS, or XML. For this
    example, pick CSV.

4.  Click *Okay*, and open the file or save it locally. Open it with your
    favorite spreadsheet program and confirm that your form entries are entered
    into a spreadsheet for you.

**Note:** The Forms application itself has an *Import/Export* window that you can
access from the application's Configuration menu
(![Configuration](../../images/icon-options.png)). This is how you import and
export the application configuration and its data (forms and form entries). The
file format for this type of import and export is a LAR file. For more
information, see the article on
[importing and exporting application content](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/importing-exporting-pages-and-content).

Once you export a batch of form entries, it can make sense to delete them from
the database.

## Deleting Form Entries [](id=deleting-form-entries)

What if you export a form's entries and now you want them to be removed from the
Liferay database? It's easy to delete all of a form's entries at once.

Navigate back to the Forms application In The Lunar Resort Content section.
Click the *Actions* (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) button next
to the Guest Survey form and select *View Entries* again. Select all entries by
checking the box next to *Filter and Order*. A trash can icon
(![Trash](../../images/icon-trash.png)) appears in the top right corner of the
Form Entries screen. Click it.

![Figure 4: Delete all form entries in one fell swoop.](../../images/forms-delete-entries.png)

If you just wanted to delete a single entry, select that entry by checking its
box; then click the trash can.

If you're worried about deleting everything irrecoverably by accident, don't
worry. You must confirm the deletion in a dialog box that pops up after clicking
the trash can.

Now you can create basic forms and manage the entries. Keep reading in this
section to learn about the many additional form building features available to
you.
