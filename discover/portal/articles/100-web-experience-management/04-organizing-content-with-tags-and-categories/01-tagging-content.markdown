# Tagging Content [](id=tagging-content)

Tags are an important tool that can help organize information and make it easier
for users to find the content they want. Tags are all-lowercase words or phrases
that you can attach to any content. Tagging content makes your search results
more accurate and enables you to use tools like the Asset Publisher to display
content in an organized fashion on a web page. 

There are two ways to create tags: through the administrative console in the
Site Administration section of the Menu or on the fly as content is created. By
default, tags can be created by regular users and users can apply them to any
assets they have permission to create or edit.

Only site administrators can access the *Tags* application in the Content
section of the Site Administration area of the Menu. Here, site administrators
can create new tags and edit any existing site tags: 

1.  Go to the site you want to create tags for and click *Content* &rarr;
    *Tags*.
 
    From this screen, you can view existing tags and create new ones.

2.  To create a new tag, click the *Add Tag* icon (![Add
    Tag](../../../images/icon-add.png)) and enter a name for the tag.

The process for adding tags during content creation is similar. For example, to
create tags for a new web content article:

1.  Go to the *Metadata* dropdown in a New Web Content menu.

2.  Add tags *lunar*, *moon*, and *spectacular*.

Once you've created the web content with these tags, the web content is
associated with those tag words when they are searched or referenced.

Tags are not the only instance-wide mechanism for describing content: the next
tutorial describes categories.
