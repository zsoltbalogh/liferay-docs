# Web Experience Management [](id=web-experience-management)

Experience: consider that word for a moment. Not the type of experience you 
gain with repetition, but the contact or encounter you have with something. 
Suppose you're buying a new phone. It's easy to look at the phone with the 
biggest screen or the fastest processor and say that it's the best, but what 
will your experience be? The "best" phone might not be the fastest or the 
biggest; it might be the phone with the longest battery life or the most 
comprehensive suite of integrated apps. Or it might not be any of those things. 
Experience isn't always something that you can quantify with specs or features.

Liferay takes the experience factor very seriously when it comes to site and 
content management. The Web Experience Management suite is focused on providing 
the best experience for users building websites. When it comes to web 
experience, just like with your phone, everyone is looking for something 
different. Some smartphone users might love watching videos during their 
commute with a big beautiful screen, while on the other side, some people might 
be more excited about a small sleek phone with a great battery life that fits 
easily in their pocket and simply does all the basic communication they need.

Liferay's Content Management is the big beautiful phone and the sleek 
utilitarian one all in one. Marketers will find easy to use tools to build 
content without having to write any code or peak under the hood. Developers 
will find powerful tools like Structures and Templates that enable them to 
create dynamic content. And designers will love how Fragments and Content pages 
provide a way to perfectly realize their designs.
