# Publishing Web Content [](id=publishing-web-content)

In the previous sections, you created and edited an article. Now it's time to 
publish it. 

1.  Go to the *Welcome* page of the Lunar Resort Site.

2.  Select the *Add* button
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-control-menu-add.png)) from the top Control 
    Menu and select the *Widget* tab.

3.  Find *Web Content Display* and add it to the page.

![Figure 1: Add the Web Content Display app to a page to begin displaying your new web content article.](../../../../images/add-web-content-display.png)
You can drag a widget to the position on the page where you want your content 
to appear. You can have as many Web Content Display widgets on a page as you 
need, which gives you the power to lay out your content exactly the way you 
want it. 

Now select the content to display:

1.  Click *Select Web Content to make it visible* in the bottom of the widget.

2.  Click *Select* under *Web Content*.

3.  Click on the article that you want to display

    If your content does not immediately appear in the list, you can search for 
    the content by title, description, user name, or Site (click the drop-down 
    arrow to see all the options).

Selecting a web content article displays the Web Content Display's
configuration page, where you can choose the User Tools and Content Metadata to
be published in the widget. These two entities have the following options to
choose from, by default:

- **User Tools**
    - *Translations*
    - *Print*
- **Content Metadata**
    - *Related Assets*
    - *Ratings*
    - *Comments*
    - *Comment Ratings*

If you have enabled OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration, you can also enable
document conversion for your content. Then users can download your content in
their format of choice. To enable OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration, go to
*Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr;
*Connectors* and check the *Server Enabled* box. Back in the Web Content
Display's configuration page, conversion options are available under the *User
Tools* list.

![Figure 2: Publishing web content is a snap. At a minimum, you only have to select the content you wish to publish. You can also enable lots of optional features to let your users interact with your content.](../../../../images/web-content-choosing-web-content.png)

**Translations:** Shows the available locales for your content. If you're working 
on the page for a particular language, you can select the translation of your 
content that goes with your locale.

**Print:** Opens the content in a separate browser window with just the
content---no navigation or other widgets.

**Ratings:** Shows one of two ratings interfaces @product@ has: five stars or
thumbs up and thumbs down. Rating types are configured in *Site Menu* &rarr;
*Configuration* &rarr; *Site Settings*.

**Comments:** Creates a discussion forum attached to your content.

By default, guests cannot leave comments on web content. If you want to allow
guests to comment on your web content article,

1.  Navigate to the Control Panel &rarr; *Users* &rarr; *Roles*

2.  Select *Guest* &rarr; *Define Permissions*.

3.  From the left menu, select *Site Administration* &rarr; *Content* &rarr; 
    *Web Content*.

4.  Navigate down to the Web Content Article heading and select the *Add 
    Discussion* checkbox. Click *Save*.

Guests can now post comments on your web content article!

You may decide you want one, some, or none of these features, which is why
they're all implemented as simple selector buttons to be enabled or disabled at
need. Once you've selected the features you want to include in your Web Content
Display widget, click *Save* and close the configuration window.

## Editing Published Content [](id=editing-published-content)

If you must edit published content, you can do it directly from the Web 
Content Display app or from Site Administration. To edit it from
the Web Content Display app,

1.  Select the *Options* button 
    (![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) from the widget's top 
    panel.

2.  Select *Edit Web Content* to launch the editor. Select *Edit Template* to
    launch the template editor for the web content article's template.

![Figure 3: You can select and edit an article, or edit its template directly from the Web Content Display app.](../../../../images/web-content-display-icons.png)

If you edit the article from Site Administration, you can also view the
article's history and use the diff tool to compare versions.

1.  Go to *Content* &rarr; *Web Content* from the Menu.

2.  Next to the article, click *Actions* icon 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *View
    History*. This shows you 

This shows you all the article's versions and modified/display dates. The diff
tool compares these versions and highlights the differences between them.

1.  Click *Actions* next to a version of the article you'd like to compare. 

2.  Select *Compare to...*.

3.  Select the version with which to compare it.

    The tool provides color coded highlighting to emphasize additions and deletions between the two articles.

![Figure 4: Comparing web content articles is a great feature to use during the Workflow process.](../../../../images/web-content-diff-feature.png)
Whenever you publish updates to a web content article that's already being
displayed, the content is immediately updated unless you have a workflow
enabled (See 
[Workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow)
for details).
