# Creating Web Content [](id=creating-web-content)

To start you'll create and publish some simple content using the WYSIWYG
editor to the home page of the Lunar Resort's web site. 

1.  Go to *Site Administration* and click the *Site Selector* button
    (![Compass](../../../../images/icon-compass.png)).

    Content is created in whichever Site is selected, so always make sure that
    you're working on the right Site. Content can also be created as Global so
    that any Site can access it.

    ![Figure 1: You can choose where to create content by navigating to the Site Administration menu and selecting your Site and page scope.](../../../../images/site-page-scopes.png)

2.  Select the *Lunar Resort* Site.

3.  Open the *Content* section and click on *Web Content*.

    Here you can create web content and organize it into folders.

4.  Click *Add* (![Add Web Content](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) &rarr; 
    *Basic Web Content* to create a new web content article.

    ![Figure 2: By default, *Basic Web Content* is the only article type available. The next tutorial covers how to create new types.](../../../../images/web-content-add-menu.png)

5.  Type *Welcome to the Lunar Resort* in the *Title* field.

6.  In the *Summary* field, give a short description of the Lunar Resort's
    facilities (be creative).

7.  In the *Content* field, add the body of your web content article, which
    you'll dive into next.

8.  Finally, leave the *Searchable* switch enabled and click *Publish*. 

    Disabling search for your article removes it from end users' search
    results. Administrators can still search for it from *Site Administration*
    &rarr; *Web Content*, and the article can still be added to pages.

That's all it takes to create Web Content, but there's much more under the 
hood of the web content editor that you'll learn about next.
