# Introduction to Web Content [](id=introduction-web-content)

Web Content Management (WCM) helps users who are not web developers publish
content with a simple point and click interface, while enabling developers to
create complex templates with dynamic elements. Once these templates have been
deployed into @product@, your non-technical users can use them to manage complex
content as easily as they would manage basic content.

It has these components: 

**Web Content Editor:** A complete HTML editor for modifying fonts, adding
color, inserting images, and much more.

**Structure Editor:** Define fields for structured content and more advanced
designs.

**Template Editor:** Import template script files or create your own template to
inform the system how to display the content within the fields determined by the
structure.

**Web Content Display:** Place web content on pages in your Site.

**Asset Publisher:** Aggregate and display different types of content together
in one view. This is covered in more detail in 
[Publishing Assets](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/publishing-assets).

**Scheduler:** Schedule when content is reviewed, displayed or removed. This
is covered in more detail in 
[Scheduling Web Content Publication](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/scheduling-web-content-publication).

**Workflow Integration:** Run your content through a review process. This is
covered in more detail in the
[Workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow) section.

**Staging:** Use a separate staging server or stage your content locally so you
can keep your changes separate from the live site. This is covered in more
detail in 
[Using the Staging Environment](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-staging-environment).

These tools streamline the content creation process for end users and are also
integrated with Liferay's services so advanced template developers can use them
to query for data stored elsewhere on your website.

To demonstrate @product@'s Web Content Management features, you'll create
and manage content on Liferay for the ambitious (and fictitious) *Lunar Resort*
project. The Lunar Resort project specializes in facilitating lunar vacations.
It provides space shuttle transportation from the Earth to the Moon and back,
offers the use of a state-of-the-art recreational facility enclosed by a large,
transparent habitat dome, and even rents out lunar rovers.
