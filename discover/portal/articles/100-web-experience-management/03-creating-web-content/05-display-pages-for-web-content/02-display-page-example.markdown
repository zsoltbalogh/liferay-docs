# Display Page Example [](id=display-page-example)

Create a new Display Page:

1.  Go to *Build* &rarr; *Pages* in Site Administration.

2.  Go to the *Display Pages* tab.

3.  Click the *Add* button (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)).

4.  Name your Display Page *Lunar Resort Display Page* and click *Submit*.

![Figure 1: The Display Page creation interface.](../../../../images/create-display-page.png)

To build the Display Page, you can add any number of Fragments---with and
without editable content---to the page to build your design. Fragments with
editable content can have their editable fields mapped to be filled by a Web
Content article. You can also base it on a specific Web Content Structure.

![Figure 2: Editing a Display Page with some Fragments added.](../../../../images/display-page-with-fragments.png)

Notice that the example has an editable title and text body, with a static
footer containing graphics and links. After you've added some fragments to the
page, you can map them like this:

1.  Click on the *Mapping* tab inside the *Fragments* section.

2.  Under *Asset Type* click *Select*.

3.  For this example, select *Web Content Article* for the Asset Type and 
    *Basic Web Content* for the subtype.

4.  Click *Save*.

5.  Now check the box that says *Show Editable Areas*. This highlights
    areas that you can map.

6.  Click on an editable text area and then click *Map*. A dialog appears with
    a list of fields that can be mapped to that area.
 
7.  Map your *Title* and *Content* to the appropriate area.

8.  Click *Publish* at the top of the page to save your work.

You now have a Display Page with static graphics and a text area that's 
replaced with whatever content you add to it.

**Note:** You can map any data or metadata from a Web Content Article or 
Structure to a Display Page. For the Basic Web Content type, this includes 
structure-defined fields like Summary, Title, and Content, as well as metadata 
fields like Publish Date, Categories, and Tags. In a user-defined structure, all
user selected fields display here as well.

3.  Name it *Thoughts About Space* and fill in some short content.

4.  Open the *Display Page* section and click *Choose*.

5.  Select the *Lunar Resort Display Page* and click *Done*.

When published, you can view the content at its Friendly URL (you can find the
Friendly URL while editing a Web Content article under *Friendly URL*) or when
you click on the content in an Asset Publisher with *Asset Link Behavior* set to
*View in Context*.
