# Display Pages for Web Content [](id=display-pages-for-web-content)

Display Pages provide a new level of control over the look and feel of your
content. Display pages empower marketers and designers to create stunning
designs for Web Content. Display Pages use both Page Fragments and Web Content
to provide an easy way to create beautiful layouts for displaying articles.

One great way to use Display Pages is to create standardized formats for 
articles. If you examine the content on many writing platforms each article
follows a similar format like this:

-  Header Image

-  Title

-  Main Body

-  Highlighted Quote
 
-  Footer with links to related articles or other content

With Display Pages, you can create standard, reusable formats like this to 
streamline the creation of attractive content. Read on to learn more!
