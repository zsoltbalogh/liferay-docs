# Creating Multi and Single Page Variations [](id=creating-multi-and-single-page-variations)

You can create two types of page variations:

- Site Pages Variation (multiple pages)
- Page Variation (single page)

You can learn more about these variations in the
[Using Multi and Single Page Variations](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-multi-and-single-page-variations).
As an example, you'll step through creating a Site pages variation next. Both
variation processes, however, are similar.

1.  Select the *Options* icon
    (![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the Staging Bar and select
    the variation option. For example, select the *Site Pages Variation* option.
    This brings you to a list of the existing Site page variations for your
    Site.

2.  Click *Add Site Pages Variation* to create a new one.

    ![Figure 1: When selecting the *Site Pages Variation* link from the Staging Bar, you're able to add and manage your Site pages variations.](../../../../images/staging-page-variations.png)

3.  Set a name and description for your new Site pages variation.

4.  Set how you want your variation created. From the *Copy Pages from Site Page
    Variation* field, you can copy content from an existing variation to create
    your new one. There are several options to choose in this selector.

    **All Site Pages Variations:** Creates a new variation that contains the
    last version marked as ready for publication from any single page existing
    in any other variation.

    **None (Empty Site Pages Variation):** Creates a new, empty variation.

    **[Existing Variations]:** Creates a new Site page variation that contains
    only the last version of all the pages that exist in a specific variation
    (e.g., *Main Variation*). The current variation must be marked as ready for
    publication.

    The copy option is not available when creating a page variation. A new page
    variation is a copy of the current Site pages variation.

5.  Click *Add* to create the Site pages variation.

**Note:** You can rename any variation after it's created, if necessary. For
example, edit the Main Variation and change its name to something that makes
more sense in your Site, such as *Basic*, *Master*, or *Regular*.

Awesome! Your Site pages variation is created and available for modification.
