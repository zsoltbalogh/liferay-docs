# Organizing Pages for Staging [](id=organizing-pages-for-staging)

Say you're working on a product-oriented Site where several major changes are
required for a page or a set of pages over a short period of time. You must work
on multiple versions of the Site at the same time to ensure everything has been
properly reviewed before it goes live. With staging, you can do this using *Page
Variations*.

In this section, you'll explore page variations and how they're useful.
