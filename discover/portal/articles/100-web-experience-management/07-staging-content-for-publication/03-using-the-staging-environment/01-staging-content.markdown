# Staging Content [](id=staging-content)

When you're on the staged site, you have several options in the Staging Bar to
help start your staging conquest.

**Site Pages Variation:** lets you work in parallel on multiple versions of a
staged site page. You can choose the site page variation from the dropdown menu
or manage them from the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the Staging Bar. See the
[Using Site Pages Variations](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-site-pages-variations)
article for more information.

**Page Variations:** lets you work in parallel on multiple versions of a staged
page. You can choose the page variation from the dropdown menu or manage them
from the *Options* icon (![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the
Staging Bar. See the
[Using Site Pages Variations](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-site-pages-variations)
article for more information.

**Undo/Redo:** steps back/forward through recent changes to a page, which can
save you the time of manually adding or removing apps if you make a mistake. To
access *Undo*/*Redo*, select the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the Staging Bar.

**History:** shows the list of revisions of the page, based on publication
dates. You can go to any change in the revision history and see how the pages
looked at that point. To access *History*, select the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the Staging Bar.

**Ready for Publication:** After you're done making changes to the staged page,
click this button. The status of the page changes from *Draft* to *Ready for
Publication* and any changes you've made can be published to the Live Site. When
you publish a page to live, only the version *Marked as Ready for Publication*
is published.

Now you'll step through a brief example for using the Staging Bar to stage and
publish content.

1.  On the staged site, navigate to the Product Menu and select *Content* &rarr;
    *Web Content*.

2.  Create a Basic Web Content article and save it.

3.  Go back to your staged site's main page and navigate to the *Add*
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) &rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Content
    Management* menu and drag the *Web Content Display* widget to the page.

4.  Select the web content article you created to display in the new widget.

5.  Select the *Ready for Publication* button to confirm you're ready to publish
    the content from the staged site to the live site. This prepares the
    staged content for publication. If workflow is enabled for any new resource,
    the resource must go through the workflow process before it can be published
    to the live site.

6.  Click the *Publish to Live* button. A pop-up window appears with
    configuration options for your publication.
 
7.  Enter the name of your publication.

8.  Observe the changes listed in the menu. This lists the changed content
    planned for publication.

9.  Click the *Publish to Live* button to publish your staged results to the
    live site.

Awesome! You've created content on the staged site and published it to your live
site. It's now available for all your site users to see!

This example explored the Simple Publication menu. If your publication requires
more advanced configuration like specifying specific content, dates, pages,
etc., you should click the *Switch to Advanced Publication* button. You'll
explore the more advanced configuration options next.
