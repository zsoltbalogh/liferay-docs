# Staging Processes and Templates [](id=staging-processes-and-templates)

When you make a staging publication, it's captured as a staging process and
stored for future reference. You can manage these processes by navigating to the
*Staging* option located in the Product Menu's Publishing tab. From there,
you'll see a list of staging processes that have been completed. You can
relaunch or clear any of these publications by clicking the *Actions* button
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to a process. If you
click the *Scheduled* tab from above, you'll find staging processes that you've
scheduled for future publication dates.

If you find yourself repeatedly creating similar staging processes, you should
think about using Publish Templates.

Instead of manually having to customize a publication process every time you're
looking to publish pages/content, you can use a publish template. With publish
templates, you can select a custom template and immediately publish with the
options you configured.

Follow the steps below to create and use a publish template.

1.  Select the *Options* icon (![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png))
    from the top right corner of the Staging screen and select *Publish
    Templates*.

2.  Click the *Add* button
    (![Add Publish Template](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) and assign the
    template a name and description, and then fill out the configuration options
    as you would during a custom publication process.

3.  Save your publish template. It's available to use from the *Publish
    Templates* tab in the *Publish to Live* menu's Advanced Publication area.

4.  To use the template, click the *Actions* button
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to the template and
    select *Publish to Live*.

    This automatically sets the options for publishing pages and their content.
    All you have to do is give the publication process a name. Once you confirm
    the configuration settings, your staging settings are published.

**Note:** When staging is enabled, the options available from the *Publishing*
tab are modified. When in the Live environment, you can only access the *Export*
feature. When in the Staging environment, you can only access the *Import* and
*Staging* features. The disabled features for each environment don't make sense
in that context. For example, you shouldn't be able to import content when in
the live environment; it must be imported into the staged environment and then
published before it is available in the live site.

Now you know how to reference stored/scheduled staging processes and create
publish templates to streamline publication.
