# Publishing Assets [](id=publishing-assets)

As you create web content, remember that pieces of content are assets, just like
message board entries and blog posts. Since the Asset Publisher publishes
assets, it excels at publishing mixed content types like images, documents,
blogs, and of course, web content. This helps in creating a more dynamic web
site: you can place user-created wiki entries, blog posts, or message board
messages in context with your web content. You'll examine some of the Asset
Publisher's features next.
