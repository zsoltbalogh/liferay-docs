# Publishing RSS Feeds [](id=publishing-rss-feeds)

RSS is a family of web feed formats used to publish frequently updated works
such as blog entries and news articles. RSS allows users to stay up-to-date with
your site's content without actually having to visit your site. Users can use 
their own RSS feed readers to aggregate content, and you can also use RSS to 
share and aggregate content across sites. Next, you'll see how to create RSS 
feeds from Asset Publisher configurations.
