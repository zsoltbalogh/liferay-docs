# Defining Content Relationships [](id=defining-content-relationships)

Related Assets are assets connected to other assets, even if they don't share
any tags and aren't in the same category. Here you'll focus on how to define
relationships between assets so when you begin publishing assets, the Related
Assets widget can display those relationships. 

## The Related Assets Widget [](id=the-related-assets-widget)

By default, the Related Assets widget displays any related asset of the asset
selected in the Asset Publisher. If you don't want to show every related asset,
you can configure what content relationships to display. To do this, follow
these steps: 

1.  Go to the Related Assets app and select the *Options* icon
    (![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the upper right corner of
    the application and click *Configuration*. 

2.  Under the *Setup* &rarr; *Asset Selection* tab, set the type of asset(s) to
    display using the *Asset Type* menu. The default value is set to *Any*. 

3.  You can narrow the scope of the app to display any single category of asset
    type or select multiple assets from the menu.

    Filter options set minimum requirements for displaying assets by their
    categories, tags, and custom fields. Ordering and Grouping organizes assets
    using the same criteria. Display settings customize how the app shows assets:
    by title, in a table, by abstract, or full content. You can convert assets to
    different document types like ODT, PDF, and RTF. You can choose to show metadata
    fields such as author, modification date, tags, and view count. You can even
    enable RSS subscriptions and customize their display settings. 

4.  When you're finished setting the Source and Filter options, click *Save*.

Now that you've configured the Related Assets widget to display specific content
types, you must define the relationships for your assets. Here's a simple
example of defining related assets for a web content article and then displaying
those related assets.

Suppose you own a gift shop at the Lunar Resort, and you want all your shop's
assets to appear when an asset is clicked. You must define relationships between
your content, so when an asset is clicked, its related assets are appear
alongside the clicked asset. Here's how to do it: 

1.  Create a blog entry explaining your gift shop's new apparel and a photo of
    the moon, just so consumers are aware that you offer the *only* gift shop on
    a desolate rock orbiting the Earth!

2.  Create a web content article describing your shop. Once you've given your
    article a title and some content, open the *Related Assets* dropdown menu.
    Click *Select*, choose *Blogs Entry*, and select the blog you created. Click
    *Select* again, choose *Basic Document*, and select the photo of the moon.
    Click *Publish* to publish your web content article.

3.  Now that those assets are created, you can relate the blog entry and
    photo to your web content article. Navigate to your article in Site
    Administration &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Web Content*.

4.  You've now defined relationship with your three assets. Click the *Add* icon
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-control-menu-add.png)) at the top of your page
    in the Control Menu, select *Applications*, and add the Related Assets and
    Asset Publisher applications to the page. Don't panic: related assets don't
    appear until you select an asset in the Asset Publisher.

Once you select an asset, its related assets appear in the Related Assets app,
as in the image above. If you want more detail, you can place two Related Assets
applications on the page and name one *Related Blogs* and the other *Related
Photos*.
