# Restoring Deleted Assets [](id=restoring-deleted-assets)

Have you ever had that life-altering experience where you deleted an important
file and immediately regretted deleting it? The deed is usually followed by a
palm to the forehead or a sick feeling. Good news! @product@ is here to turn 
that frown upside down with the *Recycle Bin* feature. With the Recycle Bin, the
*Move to the Recycle Bin* action replaces *Delete* for certain asset types.
Content is now temporarily stored in the Recycle Bin. This allows the content to
be restored back to its original state. Recycled items can expire after a
certain period of time, resulting in their permanent deletion. Before diving
into how the Recycle Bin works, you'll look at how to configure it.
