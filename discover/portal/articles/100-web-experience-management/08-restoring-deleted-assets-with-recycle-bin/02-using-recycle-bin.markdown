# Using the Recycle Bin [](id=using-the-recycle-bin)

The Recycle Bin is temporary storage where assets go when you delete 
them. You can recycle several different types of assets:

- Blogs
- Bookmarks
- Documents and Media
- Message Boards (and attachments)
- Web Content
- Wiki (and attachments)

**Note:** Attachments added to Wiki and Message Board entries do not go to the
Recycle Bin when they are deleted. They can be restored in a similar fashion 
from the *Removed Attachments* menu within the application.

To demonstrate using the Recycle Bin let's delete a web content article and 
then restore it. You'll run through two different methods of restoring the file.

1.  Go to Site Administration and select *Content* &rarr; *Web Content*.

2.  Select the *Add* button (![Add Web Content](../../../images/icon-add.png))
    and click *Basic Web Content*.

3.  Enter some text for the Title and Content and click *Publish*.

4.  Click the article's *Actions* button
    (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and click
    *Move to the Recycle Bin*.

	Note that the *Delete* button is not listed. @product@ avoids the risk of
	accidental deletion of your files by funneling the content through the
	Recycle Bin.

5.  After deleting the file, a success message appears, offering an *Undo*
    option. Click *Undo*. The web content is retrieved from the Recycle Bin and
    stored in its original place.

6.  Click *Move to the Recycle Bin* again.

7.  Go back to Site Administration and click Recycle Bin from
    the Content dropdown.

8.  Find your sample web content and click its *Actions* button.

9.  You can restore or delete the content. Select *Restore*.

10. Navigate back to the Web Content screen and notice that your sample web
    content is back to its original place.

That covers the two general processes of sending and restoring content to/from 
the Recycle Bin. For other asset types, the Recycle Bin works similarly.

Some applications, such as Web Content and Documents and Media, 
support folders for organizing content. You can also send folders to the 
Recycle Bin. Keep in mind that this sends any sub-folders of the deleted folder 
all the files it contains to the Recycle Bin. Folders are restored and deleted 
the same way as a single file.

*Delete* within the Recycle Bin is the permanent delete button. Once you 
select this, your file cannot be retrieved and is gone forever. There is also 
an *Empty the Recycle Bin* option accessible from the
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) button at the top of the Recycle
Bin screen. This permanently deletes all the files from the Recycle Bin.

## Drag and Drop [](id=drag-and-drop)

You can also drag and drop items into the Recycle Bin. While you're in the 
Control Panel, select an asset and drag it to the Recycle Bin portlet on the 
Control Panel menu. When you click and begin dragging the asset, a message 
appears near your cursor notifying you of the number of files ready to be 
moved, and the Recycle Bin is highlighted, showing you where the files can be 
dropped. After you drop the asset onto the Recycle Bin portlet, the asset is 
removed from its original location and transferred to the Recycle Bin.
