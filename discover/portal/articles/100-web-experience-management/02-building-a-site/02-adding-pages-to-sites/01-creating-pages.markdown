# Creating Pages [](id=creating-pages)

After you create a Site, you can add new pages and maintain them. You can do
everything you need with pages from Site Administration.

1.  If you're not currently on the Site you want to edit, click the *Site 
    Selector* button (![Compass](../../../../images/icon-compass.png)) next to 
    your current Site name in the Menu and select your desired Site.

2.  Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Build*.

3.  Click on *Site Pages*

From here, you'll create pages and page templates.

Note: Pages are always part of page sets, and page sets are always associated
with Sites. Even users' personal pages are part of their personal Sites. All
pages belong to one of two types of page sets: public pages and private pages.
By default, anyone can access public pages, even non-logged in users (guests).
Only users who are members of the Site that owns the pages can access private
pages. This means the private pages of an organization's Site are viewable only
by Site members and members of the organization.

From *Site Pages* you can do several things:

1.  Click the `+` button in the top right corner to add a new page.

2.  Click *Filter and Order* to create pages in the Public or Private page sets
    using the selector.

3.  Create child pages by clicking the `+` button next to an existing page.

![Figure 2: Understanding the options on Site Pages.](../../../../images/site-pages-breakdown.png)

Adding a child page creates child pages in the hierarchy below the page you've 
selected. You can nest pages as deep as you like and you can manage that 
hierarchy through Navigation Menus. 

Once you've clicked the `+` icon to add a page, you're asked to select the type
of page you are creating. There are two top options followed by other page 
types:

**Widget:** Creates a page with a layout template that defines a number of rows
and columns for adding widgets to your page.

**Content:** Creates a Content Page with inline editing based on Fragments.

Below those you have other options:

**Full Page Application:** Creates a page that displays a single full page
application.

**Page Set:** Creates a container for subpages that is not actually a page
itself. 

**Link to a Page of this Site:** Links to a page within the same Site. This is
often used to make a page available in multiple parts of a Sites hierarchy.

**Panel:** A page containing any number of applications as selected by an
administrator, but only one is displayed at a time. Users select the portlet
they want to use from a menu on the left side of the page, and the selected
portlet takes up the entire page. 

**Embedded:** Displays content from another website inside your instance. An
administrator can set a URL from the page management interface and that page
appears in the context and within the navigation of your Liferay instance.

**Link to URL:** Creates a link to any URL. This could be an external page or
a link across Sites in the same Liferay instance.

To the left, under Collections, you can choose to view the basic page types
or a collection of page templates. By default, only *Global Templates*
appears, but additional collections you create appear here as well.

![Figure 3: You must select a page type when adding pages.](../../../../images/page-types-adding.png)

After you've added a page, it may be difficult to track what kind of page you're
currently viewing. The page type appears at the top of the page to help you
determine the administration options you have and where you need to go to
configure the page.

Now that you know the basics of adding pages, you can start working on the Lunar
Resort Site. If you're not currently on the right Site, navigate to Site
Administration in the Menu, select the compass icon next to the current Site
name, and select the Site you wish to edit.

If you must ever modify the page you've created for your Site, select
*Configure* from the Options menu for the page from *Site Pages*. When
configuring a specific page, you have more options than when you were creating
a new page. You can also read 
[Configuring Sites](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-sites).

There are also configuration options that are only available for individual
pages or page groups only. You'll learn about options available for both
instances.

Next, you'll look at creating the main page types you'll use in Liferay.
