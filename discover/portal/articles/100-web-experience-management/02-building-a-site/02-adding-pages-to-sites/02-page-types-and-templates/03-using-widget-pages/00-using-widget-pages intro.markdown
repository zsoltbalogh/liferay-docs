# Using Widget Pages [](id=adding-applications-to-a-page)

Widget Pages are composed of "widgets." A widget is any application that you can
add to a page. Widget Pages are constructed by adding widgets to the page and
filling them with content.

A widget could be a wiki display or a dynamic publishing tool like the Asset
Publisher. The content you display with widgets could be long-form text or an
image gallery, or anything in between. In this section, you'll learn to create
widget pages and build content with them.
