# Creating Widget Pages [](id=creating-widget-pages)

Widget Pages are the classic type of page in @product@. They're simple to create
and fill with content or functionality. You create a blank page, define
a layout, and then add widgets to the layout. Widgets can display content or
provide some tool or function for Users.

## Adding a Widget Page [](id=adding-a-widget-page)

When you first start @product@ you get a widget page by default as your home
page. To create a new widget page,

1.  Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Build* &rarr; *Pages*.

2.  Click the *Add* icon (
    ![Add](../../../../../../images/icon-add.png)) in the top right and select 
    *Public Page* to add a new page.
 
3.  Select *Basic Pages* if it is not selected by default.

4.  Select the *Widget Page* type. 

5.  Name the page *Community* and leave the box checked to *Add this Page to the
    following Menus: Default*.
 
6.  Click *Submit*.
 
7.  On the next screen, you can select a Layout Template or manage other 
    options. Leave the defaults and click *Save*.

Creating a page by default also adds it to any Navigation Menus that are 
configured to have new pages added to them. If you don't want a new page added 
to a specific Navigation Menu that is listed during page creation, uncheck the 
box for that menu.

Your new page is now added to the navigation.

1.  Click the logo in the top left of the page to go back to your Site's front
    page. The page you just created appears in the main navigation.
 
2.  Click on *Community* to go to the page.

Currently the page is empty. Next you'll add some widgets to give it functionality.

## Adding Widgets to a Page [](id=adding-widgets-to-a-page)

To add widget to a page, go to the page and click the *Add* button 
(![Add](../../../../../../images/icon-control-menu-add.png)) 
from the top menu and select the *Widgets* tab. You can either browse
through the categories of available widgets until you find the one you want, or 
you can search for widgets by name. Once you've found a widget, click the 
*Add* button to add it to the current page. Once there, you can drag it to a 
new position. Alternatively, you can drag the widget directly from the Widgets 
menu to a specific location on the page. Follow the steps below to add some
Collaboration apps to the Lunar Resort Site.

1.  From the top menu, select *Add* &rarr; *Widgets*.

2.  In the menu that appears, expand the *Collaboration* category.

3.  Drag the *Blogs Aggregator* app from the Add Application window to the right
    column of your page.

4.  Next, drag the *Wiki* app to the left column.

See how easy it is to add applications to your pages? You've added the Wiki
app and Blogs Aggregator app to a page.

If the default layout options provided aren't enough, you can create your own.
