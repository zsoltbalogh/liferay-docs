# Building a Responsive Site [](id=building-a-responsive-site)

Now more than half of all page views in the world come from mobile devices 
like phones and tablets. That means that if your pages don't look good on 
mobile devices, your pages don't look good for more than half the people
looking at them. @product@ can provide the best experience possible no matter
what device you're using.

Most of the heavy lifting for mobile optimization comes from your developers.
Themes must be designed to be responsive. Web Content Structures and Templates
and Page Fragments must be created with code that transitions gracefully to fit
smaller screens on mobile devices. But there's work to do for marketers and
administrators as well.
