# Creating and Managing Site Navigation Menus [](id=creating-and-managing-site-navigation-menus)

With @product-ver@, pages are now decoupled from menus. Navigation Menus let you
arrange your page taxonomy any way you want. Marketers can leave one-off
marketing landing pages out of the navigation, and you can create 
multiple navigation menus: a main menu, secondary menus, footer menus, and
custom menus for anything that you can dream up.

On a large, complex site you can have a Navigation Menu that displays a simple
list of frequently visited pages and move the rest of the pages to secondary
navigation. You can also create specific menus for different landing pages to
direct users to content that is relevant to them.

The default menu functions just like it always has: when you add a page, it's
added to the menu. You can create sub-pages and build the page hierarchy any way
you like. Go to *Navigation* &rarr; *Site Pages* to view the existing pages or
create new pages.

The site hierarchy as displayed on *Site Pages* is the main reference for the
organization of pages on that Site. While Navigation menus can customize their
organization and what appears and what doesn't appear, this menu is always the
primary reference for the pages on your Site.
