# Creating and Managing Navigation Menus [](id=creating-and-managing-navigation-menus)

To better understand Navigation Menus, it's time to create a new menu.

## Creating a Navigation Menu [](id=creating-a-navigation-menu)

1.  Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Build* &rarr; *Navigation Menus*.

2.  Click the `+` button to add a new menu.

3.  Give your menu a name and click *Submit*.

On the next page appears a number of elements that you can add to a menu.

**Page**: Select an existing page from the current Site to add to the navigation
menu.

**Submenu**: Create a second level of menu navigation.

**URL**: Create a link to any page anywhere by providing a URL. The link appears
just like any other option in your menu.
 
Click on *Page* and you see a view of all the current pages on the current Site.
Select a page and click *Add* to add that page to the menu.

**Note:** When you click on a page, you select that page. Multiple pages can be
selected by clicking on each page one at a time. To deselect a page, click on
the page again.

Now you see the menu management screen. From here, you can drag and drop menu
elements to rearrange or nest them. You can also manage options for this menu by
clicking the gear icon in the top right. Let's add another item to the menu.

1.  Click the `+` icon.

2.  Select *Submenu* in the menu that pops up.

3.  Name your menu *External Links*.

4.  Click *Add*.

Click the `+` button again and select *URL*. You're prompted to enter a page
name and URL.

1.  Enter a *Name*.

2.  Enter the *URL* for an external Site.

3.  Click *Add*.

Drag the URL item onto the *External Links* submenu. This nests the URL item in
the submenu.

## Managing Menus [](id=managing-menus)

After you create a menu, more configuration options appear on the main
Navigation Menus page. 

**Title**: Your menu's name. 

**Add New Pages**: Determines if new pages added to the main navigation are
added to the menu automatically. 

**Marked As**: Can be set as *Primary Navigation*, *Secondary Navigation*, or
*Social Navigation*.
 
**Author**: The user that created the menu.

**Create Date**: When the menu was created.

Theme and Fragment developers primarily use the menu types to determine how
a menu should be styled. **Primary Navigation** is the main navigation for
a page. **Secondary Navigation** is a second level of navigation, possibly
a sidebar or a separate menu within a page. **Social Navigation** is for menus
that contain links for sharing content on social media or similar tasks.

Next click on the options menu at the far left of your new navigation menu:

**Rename**: Change the name of your menu.

**Permissions**: Define who can view, update, delete, and manage the permissions
for the menu.
 
**Mark As**: Change the menu type.

**Delete**: Deletes the menu.

Next you'll learn about the tools for displaying menus on pages.
