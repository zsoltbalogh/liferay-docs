# Building a Site [](id=building-a-site)

A site is a set of pages where content or applications are published. Sites can
be independent or serve as an associated organization's website. You can create
as many different sites as you like within the context of a single Liferay
instance.

You'll start with a tour of the site management user interface. Then you'll
create a custom Lunar Resort Example instance and explore ways to create sites
and pages for that Liferay instance. Finally, you'll learn how to change various
settings for sites and pages to meet your needs. To begin building a site,
continue on to the next section.
