# Configuring Sites [](id=configuring-sites)

Just like there's more than one way to cook and an egg --- or eat an egg for 
that matter --- there's more than one way to build a site. Liferay is created 
with that in mind, and beyond just creating content and pages, Liferay has a 
wealth of configuration options and tools available to help you create the site 
that meets your needs and the needs of your users.

In this section, you'll explore all of Liferay's options for configuring sites, 
and gain a deeper understanding of why you might want to use various options 
and configurations.
