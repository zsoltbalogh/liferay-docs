# ADT Example [](id=adt-example)

Now that you know the general functions of ADTs, you'll create your own. This
brief demonstration will show you just how easy, yet powerful, ADTs can be for
your Liferay instance.

1.  Add the Media Gallery widget to a page by navigating to *Add*
    (![Add](../../../../../images/icon-control-menu-add.png)) &rarr; *Widgets*
    &rarr; *Content Management* &rarr; *Media Gallery*.

2.  Click the widgets's *Add* button (![Actions](../../../../../images/icon-app-add.png))
    &rarr; *Multiple Media* and select two custom photos to display. Then click
    *Save*, and navigate back to the main application screen.

3.  Notice the default format of the pictures. To change the display template 
    for this widget, navigate to *Options*
    (![Options](../../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) &rarr; *Configuration*.

4.  From the *Display Template* drop-down menu, select *Carousel*. Then click
    *Save*.

	![Figure 1: After applying the Carousel ADT, your pictures are displayed as a carousel slideshow.](../../../../../images/adt-carousel.png)

	The Media Gallery application is transformed into a carousel slideshow. At
	this time, it's perfectly natural to be experiencing "I can conquer the
	world" feelings, just as Liferay's mascot, Ray, exudes in the image above.
	ADTs have that kind of power to transform your site into an enjoyable and
	convenient home for users.

Customizing the user interface of @product@'s bundled widgets provides the 
ultimate customization experience for Liferay users.
