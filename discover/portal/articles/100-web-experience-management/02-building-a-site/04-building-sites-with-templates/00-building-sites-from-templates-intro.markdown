# Building Sites from Templates [](id=building-sites-from-templates)

Site Templates create a single Site structure that can be used for any new Site.
They are created and administered from the Control Panel. In addition to
creating multiple Sites with the same design, you can also use them to manage
changes across multiple Sites with propagation of changes. Site templates can
contain multiple pages, each with its own theme, layout template, applications,
and app configurations.

Site templates can also contain content just like actual Sites. This allows 
administrators to use Site Templates to create new Sites that are each created 
with the same default pages, applications, and content. After they've been 
created, these Sites and their pages can be modified by Site administrators. 
Using Site templates can save Site administrators a lot of work even if each 
Site that was created from a given Site Template ends up being very different.
