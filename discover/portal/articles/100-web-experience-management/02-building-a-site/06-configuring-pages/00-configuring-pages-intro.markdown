# Customizing Page Options [](id=customizing-page-options)

Every page has options to give it a unique configuration. You can handle that 
configuration at the individual page level or configure a Page Set of public or 
private pages all at once.

When you configure options across Sites, Page Sets, and individual pages, there 
is a hierarchy that flows down. For example, you can set a theme at the Site
level that applies to all pages within a Site. You could then set a different
theme for the Private Pages set. You can even set a different theme for
a specific page that is different than the master site configuration or the
configuration for its page set.

When configuring pages, be aware of your context, so you don't configure an
option that you intended for the whole site just on one page---or change the
whole site's configuration, when you meant to change it for only a specific
page.
