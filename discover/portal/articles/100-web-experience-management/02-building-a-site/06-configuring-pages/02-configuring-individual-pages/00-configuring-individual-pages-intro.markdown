# Configuring Individual Pages [](id=configuring-individual-pages)

After you've configured your Page Set, you can reconfigure some options at the
individual page level. When you decide to customize a single page, options that
were not available when initially creating a page appear. You can customize
a page by navigating to *Pages* under *Build* menu and selecting *Options*
(![Options](../../../../../images/icon-options.png)) &rarr; *Configure*
next to the page you want to edit from the navigation tree. Alternatively, you
can click the *Configure* icon on the top right of any page.
