# Creating and Managing Pages [](id=creating-and-managing-pages)

You've successfully created a site for your Liferay instance, but you may need
to add new pages or edit existing pages. From the Site Administration &rarr;
*Navigation* section of the Menu, your site pages can be accessed and
configured. If you're not currently on the site you'd like to edit, click the
*Site Selector* button (![Compass](../../../images/icon-compass.png)) next to your
current site name in the Menu and select your desired site. The edits you make
to your pages are only made to the scope you've selected in the Menu.

![Figure 1: The Pages menu allows you to edit your site pages as a whole.](../../../images/managing-site-pages.png)

To add new pages to your site, click the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) for the page or page set
you'd like to add a page to and select *Add Public Page*. Likewise, you can
select *Add Private Page* to add a private site page. You can manage a plethora
of options from the Navigation menu including page name, page layout, and page
template.

You can also edit pages from the Navigation menu. To do this, select *Configure*
from the Options icon next to a page or page set, which allows you to edit the
page's basic information and configuration options.

![Figure 2: The *Options* button next to a page or page set allows you to add a child page, edit the existing page(s), or delete the page(s).](../../../images/web-content-managing-single-page.png)

In summary, the Navigation menu is used to navigate to pages, create new pages, and
edit existing pages. Note that you can also switch to managing a set of pages in
the Pages menu. Click on *Public Pages* or *Private Pages* (if private pages
exist in your site) to manage that page group.

@product@'s page groups are always associated with sites. Even users' personal
pages are part of their personal sites. All pages belong to one of two types of
page sets: public pages and private pages. By default, public pages are
accessible to anyone, even non-logged in users (guests). Private pages are
accessible only to users who are members of the site which owns the pages. This
means the private pages of an organization's site would only be viewable by
site members and members of the organization. 

Regardless of whether the pages are public or private, @product@ uses the same
interface to manage them. You'll look at this interface more closely next. 

## Creating Pages [](id=creating-pages)

From the Navigation sub-menu in the main Menu, you can add a page or child page to
any existing page or page set by clicking the *Add Page* button. Because *Public
Pages* is selected on the left, clicking *Add Page* here adds a top level page
making it a sibling page of the Welcome page. You can, however, nest pages as
deeply as you like. To create a sub-page under the Welcome page, select the *Add
Child Page* button next to *Welcome*.

The *Add Child Page* button lets you create child pages underneath the page
you've selected. You can nest pages as deep as you like but for every page below
the top level hierarchy you should provide navigation to it via a Navigation or
Breadcrumb app, at least with most themes (including the default). Developers
can create themes which have cascading menu bars which show the full hierarchy.
Some examples of that are in Liferay's plugin repositories.

+$$$

**Note:** The Navigation Menu app lets you configure a root page. This allows
building navigation menus based on the page hierarchy under a specific page.
You're given options in the Navigation Menu app's *Configuration* menu to
specify the root page, root page level, and included pages.

$$$

Once you've selected the *Add Page* or *Add Child Page* button, you're directed
to an *Add New Page* interface that lets you configure the page to your liking.
If you later decide you don't like the order of your pages, you can drag and
drop them in the list to put them in whatever order you want. Go ahead and add
another top level page and name it *Community*.

![Figure 3: You can add a page to your site by giving it a name, page template, and page type.](../../../images/web-content-add-page.png)

When you create a new page, you can create either a blank page or a page
prepopulated with apps from a page template. When you're entering the name
of the page, you can select from a list of page templates that are currently
available. You can learn more about Page Templates and how to use them in the
[Creating Pages from Templates](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-pages-from-templates) 
section. To view the page you've added, click the page name from the left panel.
By default, all pages are created as an empty page but in some situations, you
might want to use one of the other options. You can take a look at all the page
options you have below, along with their respective descriptions.

**Empty Page:** the default pages that are used. They have a layout which you
can drag and drop portlets into. This page type creates an empty page with
configurable column sizes.

**Content Display Page:** are used to search available content, explore related
content with tags, and browse content catagories. This is a specialized page
dedicated to managing web content from a page.

**Blog:** display content related to blogs. This is a specialized page dedicated
to creating, editing, and viewing blogs.

**Wiki:** display content related to wikis. This is a specialized page
dedicated to creating, managing, and viewing wiki articles from a page.

**Page Set:** exists as a container that holds child pages. These pages are not
intended to hold content. Because the page holds no content and has no purpose
but to hold other child pages, there is no friendly URL for this page. It also
cannot serve as a landing page for a site.

**Panel:** can have any number of portlets on them, as selected by an
administrator, but only one will be displayed at a time. Users select which
portlet they want to use from a menu on the left side of the page and the
selected portlet takes up the entire page. 

**Link to URL:** are redirects to any URL specified by an administrator. You can
use URL pages to create links to pages belonging to other sites of your Liferay
instance or to pages of an external site. Use URL pages cautiously since blind
redirects create a poor user experience.

**Embedded:** display content from another website inside of your instance.
An administrator can set a URL from in the page management interface and that
page will appear in the context and within the navigation of your Liferay
instance.

**Full Page Application:** creates a page with one column that displays a single
full page application.

**Link to a Page of This Site:** creates a page which functions as an immediate
redirect to another page within the same site. You can select which page to link
to from a dropdown in the page management interface. You could use a *Link to a
Page of This Site* to place a deeply nested page in the primary navigation menu
of your site, for example.

**Copy of a Page of This Site:** displays a copy of a pre-existing page in your
Liferay instance.

Now that you know the basics of adding site pages, you can start working on the
Lunar Resort site. If you're not currently on the site you're interested in
adding pages to, navigate to Site Administration in the Menu, select the compass
icon next to the current site name, and select the site you wish to edit.

If you're creating a site with many pages and sub-pages, the side panel view may
seem constricted. In the Navigation menu, you have the option to expand the Pages
view to allow for more room to work. Select the page set's *Options* icon and
select *Expand* to see a full view of your page hierarchy.

![Figure 4: Expanding your page view gives you much more room to visualize your page hierarchy.](../../../images/expand-page-hierarchy.png)

As stated previously, if you ever need to modify the page you've created for
your site, select the *Configure Page* button from the Options button from the
Navigation menu in the Menu. When configuring a specific page, you're given more
options than when you were creating a new page. These extended options for
configuring specific pages are covered in more detail later in this section.

There are also configuration options that are only available for either
indiviual pages or page groups only. You'll learn about options available for
both instances.

You should be able to define and manage pages in Liferay at this point so next,
you'll look at the options you have available for configuring your public or
private pages as a whole, and the individual pages residing within those groups.

### Customizing the Look and Feel of Site Pages [](id=customizing-the-look-and-feel-of-site-pages)

When you select *Configure* for a page set, it defaults to the Look and Feel
tab. On this tab, you're presented with an interface that allows you to choose a
theme for the current site. Themes can transform the entire look of the portal.
They are created by developers and are easily installed using the Liferay
Marketplace. Since you don't have any themes beyond the default one installed
yet, you'll use the default theme for your pages.

![Figure 5: The Look and Feel interface allows you to choose a theme for the current site.](../../../images/look-and-feel-pages.png)

Many themes include more than one color scheme. This allows you to keep the
existing look and feel while giving your site a different flavor. The *Color
Schemes* option is not available for the default theme.

<!--
Change the color scheme from blue to green by selecting *Dark* under *Color
Schemes*. If you now go back to the site (by clicking the *Go to Site* button
located under the Site Administration dropdown menu), you'll see some parts of
the page are now tinged with a darker hue.

If you apply a color scheme to a set of public or private pages, it is, by
default, applied to each page in the set. If, however, you click the *Edit Page*
button for a specific page, you can select *Define a specific look and feel for
this page* from the *Look and Feel* tab to make the color scheme apply to this
page only. You can use this feature to choose a different color scheme for a
particular page than the one defined for the set of public or private pages to
which it belongs.

------------

TODO: The Color Schemes option is not currently available for the default
theme. Checked with Julio and he said color schemes are still available, but not
for the current default theme. He's requesting different color schemes be added
before the 7.0 release so the options are available by default (instead of only
with custom themes. Therefore, I'm leaving the docs here assuming this gets
finished. Need to confirm. -Cody -->

There are a few more configurable settings for your theme. You can switch the
bullet style between dots and arrows and you can choose whether or not to show
maximize/minimize application links by default. The *CSS* section allows you to
enter custom CSS that will also be served up by your theme. In this way, you can
tweak a theme in real time by adding new styles or overriding existing ones.

The next option configures the logo that appears for your site. 

### Using a Custom Logo for a Site [](id=using-a-custom-logo-for-a-site)

By default, the Liferay logo is used for your site pages' logo. If you want to
use your own logo for a specific site, use the *Logo* tab. Adding a custom logo
is easy: select the *Logo* tab from the *Configure* interface and browse
to the location of your logo. Make sure your logo fits the space in the top left
corner of the theme you're using for your web site. If you don't, you could wind
up with a site that's difficult to navigate, as other page elements are pushed
aside to make way for the logo.

In the logo tab, you can also choose whether or not to display the site name on
the site. If you check the box labeled *Show Site Name*, the site name will
appear next to the logo. This option is enabled by default and cannot be
disabled if the *Allow Site Administrators to set their own logo* option is
disabled in *Instance Settings*. Removing the site name is not available for the
default site -- only newly created sites and user pages have the option to have
the name display. 

### Executing JavaScript in Site Pages [](id=executing-javascript-in-site-pages)

If you click on *Advanced* for a page set (either Public Pages or Private
Pages), you'll find a window where you can enter JavaScript code that will be
executed at the bottom of every page in the site. If your site's theme uses
JavaScript (as is usually the case), it's best to add custom JavaScript code to
the theme and *not* in this window. This way, all of your site's JavaScript code
remains in one place.

Using the JavaScript window may be useful if your site's theme does *not* use
JavaScript. In this case, the JavaScript window will contain *all* of your
site's JavaScript and you can add some dynamic features to your site's pages.

Next, you'll look at an advanced features of the *Configure* interface: merging
the current site's pages with the pages of the default site.

### Merging Pages From Other Sites [](id=merging-pages-from-other-sites)

If you click on *Advanced* &rarr; *Advanced* from the Edit Public Pages
interface, you'll find an option to merge the public pages of your instance's
default site with the public pages of the current site. If you enable this
option, the pages of the default site appear in the current site's navigation
menu, along with the current site's pages. Also, the pages of the current site
appear in the navigation menu of the default site, along with the default site's
pages. This "merging" of pages only affects the list of pages in the default
site's and the current site's navigation menus. This lets users more easily
navigate from the current site to the default site, and vice versa. This option
can be enabled for the public pages of both personal sites and regular sites.

Note that this merging of pages is not a "hard merge". For example, suppose that
the site administrators of twenty different sites on your Liferay instance all
enabled the *Merge Liferay public pages* option. Would the pages of all these
different sites be merged into each site's navigation menu? No, that would make a
mess! Instead, @product@ keeps track of the current `scopeGroupId` (the ID of the
current site) and the previous `scopeGroupId` (the ID of the previously visited
site). If the *Merge Liferay public pages* option is enabled for either the
current site or the previous site, the pages of the default site are merged in
the pages of the other site.

For example, suppose that your Liferay instance has three sites: the default
site, site A, and site B. All three sites have some public pages. Site A has the
*Merge Liferay public pages* option enabled; site B does not. When a user first
logs in, he's directed to the default site. The `scopeGroupId` is that of the
default site and there is no previous `scopeGroupId`, so no additional pages
appear in the default site's navigation menu. Then suppose the user navigates to
site A. Site A has the *Merge Liferay public pages* option enabled, so the
default site's pages are added to site A's navigation menu. Now if the user goes
back to the default site, site A becomes the previous site so site A's pages are
added to the default site's navigation menu. If the user navigates to site B, no
additional pages appear in site B's navigation menu because site B does not have
the *Merge Liferay public pages* option enabled. And if the user navigates back
to the default site, site B becomes the previous site, and, again, since site B
does not have the *Merge Liferay public pages* option enabled, no additional
pages are added to the default site's navigation menu.

### Rendering Pages for Mobile Devices [](id=rendering-pages-for-mobile-devices)

You can configure your page set for mobile devices by selecting the *Advanced*
tab and selecting *Mobile Device Rules* option. The ability to modify themes for
regular browsers and mobile devices can only be accomplished by using this
option. Mobile device rules are inherited from your Public Pages, but you can
define specific rules per page. With the ability to define different rules per
page, you can edit the Look and Feel of specific pages for mobile devices,
including the theme.

<!-- Add following sentence when this section is available (App not available
for CE) -Cody:
The set up for this option is explained in the
[Displaying Site Pages to Mobile Devices](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/displaying-pages-on-mobile-devices)
section.
-->

### Configuring Rules for Virtual Hosting [](id=configuring-rules-for-virtual-hosting)

If you're using virtual hosting for this site, you can configure `robots.txt`
rules for the domain by selecting the *Robots* option from the *Advanced* tab.
The Robots page gives you the option to configure your `robots.txt` for both
public and private pages on a site. If you don't have Virtual Hosting set up,
this tab is rather boring.

### Notifying Search Engines of Site Pages [](id=notifying-search-engines-of-site-pages)

If you select the *Sitemap* option from the *Advanced* tab for a page set, you
can send a sitemap to some search engines so they can crawl your site. It uses
the sitemap protocol, which is an industry standard. You can publish your site
to Yahoo or Google and their web crawlers will use the sitemap to index your
site. @product@ makes this very simple for administrators by generating the
sitemap XML for all public web sites.

By selecting one of the search engine links, the sitemap will be sent to them.
It's only necessary to do this once per site. The search engine crawler will
periodically crawl the sitemap once you've made the initial request.

If you're interested in seeing what is being sent to the search engines, select
the *preview* link to see the generated XML.

Next, you'll learn how to customize individual site pages.

## Customizing Pages [](id=customizing-pages)

When you decide to customize a single page, some different options that were not
available when initially creating a page appear. Customizing a specific page can
be done by navigating to the Navigation menu in the main Menu and selecting the
*Options* icon next to the specific page you'd like to edit from the navigation
tree. From the Options dropdown, select *Configure Page*. There are three groups
that the options for customizing a specific page can be defined under. You'll
learn what each group offers for your site pages.

### Managing Page Content [](id=managing-page-content)

Managing your page's content drastically improves your page's organization and
user experience. The site page's configuration options offers some oppurtunities
to organize page content for your Lunar Resort site.

#### Categorization [](id=categorization)

You can explore ways to tag and categorize your page by clicking the *SEO* tab,
which shows how the categorization options by default. These tools help
administrators organize the page and allows for users to easily find your page
and its content through search and navigation. For more information on using
tags and categories, visit the
[Organizing Content with Tags and Categories](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/organizing-content-with-tags-and-categories)
section.

#### Custom Fields [](id=custom-fields)

*Custom Fields* lets you edit the custom fields you already have configured for
the *Page* resource, which is accessible from the *Advanced* tab. If you don't
have any custom fields configured in your site, this option is not available. If
you don't have any custom fields configured for the Page resource, you can
navigate to the Control Panel &rarr; *Custom Fields* located under the
*Configuration* tab. These are metadata about the page and can be anything you
like, such as author or creation date. For more information on Custom Fields,
see the [Custom Fields](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/custom-fields)
section.

<!-- TODO: replace link above. -Cody -->

### Improving Page Usability [](id=improving-page-usability)

One of the most important tasks for administrators is ensuring the user
experience is easy and enjoyable. There are configuration options that aid in
providing a seamless user experience for your site page.

#### Details [](id=details)

The first option you're given (and the default option selected when customizing
an indiviual page) is *Details*. This option lets you name the page for any
localizations you need, set whether the page is hidden on the navigation menu,
set an easy to remember, friendly URL for the page, and select the page type.
Plus you can specify how apps are arranged on a page. Choose from the
available installed templates to modify the layout. It's very easy for
developers to define custom layouts and add them to the list. This is covered
more thoroughly in the
[Creating a Layout Template Project in the Plugins SDK](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-a-layout-template-project-in-the-plugins-sdk)
tutorial.

<!-- TODO: Update tutorial link to 7.0, when available. -Cody -->

#### Look and Feel [](id=look-and-feel)

The *Look and Feel* option lets you set a page-specific theme. You can inherit
what you already have configured for your page sets' theme, or you can uniquely
define them per page. You can see the Page Set's
[Customizing the Look and Feel of Site Pages](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-and-managing-pages#customizing-the-look-and-feel-of-site-pages)
section for more details.

#### Mobile Device Rules [](id=mobile-device-rules)

This option allows you to apply rules for how this page should be rendered for
various mobile devices. You can set these up by navigating to your Site
Administration dropdown menu and selecting *Configuration* &rarr; *Mobile Device
Families*.

<!-- TODO: Device Recognition app is no longer provided on Marketplace. Need to
figure out how this is changing Mobile Device Rules (section still available in
Page Settings. -Cody -->

#### Embedded Portlets [](id=embedded-portlets)

This option only appears if you have embedded one or more portlets on
the page. Previous to @product@ 7.0, you were able to embed portlets on a page by
acquring their portlet ID and using a `runtime-portlet` tag in the Web Content
Display app to embed a portlet on a page. This is no longer possible.

Applications can now be embedded on a page via web content template. To learn
more about this, see the
[Adding Templates](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/designing-uniform-content#adding-templates)
section. Also, you can embed a portlet on a page layout or theme programtically.
If you're interested in learning more about this, visit the
[Embedding Portlets in Themes and Layout Templates](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/embedding-portlets-in-themes-and-layout-templates)
tutorial.

#### Customization Settings [](id=customization-settings)

This configuration option located in the *Advanced* tab lets you mark specific
sections of the page you want users to be able to customize. You can learn more
about page customizations in the
[Personalizing Pages](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-and-managing-pages#personalizing-pages)
section.

### Enhancing Page Intelligence [](id=enhancing-page-intelligence)

Your page's configuration options offers several oppurtunities to improve your
page's data optimization and JavaScript, among others. To enhance your page's
intelligence, configure the options described below.

#### SEO [](id=seo)

*SEO* provides several means of optimizing the data the page provides to an
indexer that's crawling the page, which is accessible from the *SEO* tab. You
can set the various meta tags for description, keywords and robots. There's also
a separate Robots section that lets you tell indexing robots how frequently the
page is updated and how it should be prioritized. If the page is localized, you
can select a box to make @product@ generate canonical links by language. If you
want to set some of these settings for the entire site, you can specify them
from the Sitemaps and Robots tabs of the Manage Site Settings dialog box (see
below).

In previous versions of Liferay, it was possible that a single page
could be indexed multiple times. In Liferay Portal 6.1, all URLs that direct to the
same page will only create one entry in the index. Previously, the simple URL
*http\://www.lunar-resort.com/web/guest/blog/-/blogs/themoon* and different
versions of the URL which provided additional information about the referring
page had different entries in the index. In @product@ 7.0, each asset (web
content article, blog entry, etc.) has a unique URL. From the search engine's
point of view, this will make your pages rank higher since any references to
variations of a specific URL will all be considered references to the same
page.

#### JavaScript [](id=javascript)

If you click on *Advanced* &rarr; *JavaScript*, you'll find a window where you
can enter JavaScript code that will be executed at the bottom of your page. If
your site's theme uses JavaScript (as is usually the case), it's best to add
custom JavaScript code to the theme and *not* in this window. This way, all of
your site's JavaScript code remains in one place.

This configuration option is also available for page sets like Public Pages and
Private Pages. Visit the
[Executing JavaScript in Site Pages](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-and-managing-pages#executing-javascript-in-site-pages)
section for more information on doing this for page sets.

#### Advanced [](id=advanced)

The *Advanced* option contains several optional features. You can set a query
string to provide parameters to the page. This can become useful to web content
templates, which you'll see in the next chapter. You can set a target for the
page so that it either pops up in a particularly named window or appears in a
frameset. And you can set an icon for the page that appears in the navigation
menu.

Next you'll learn how to add applications to a site page.

## Adding Applications to a Page [](id=adding-applications-to-a-page)

@product@ pages are composed of applications. All of your site's functionality,
from blogs to shopping, is composed of apps. Even static web content can be
displayed through Web Content Display apps. To add an app to a page, just click
the *Add* button
(![Add](../../../images/icon-control-menu-add.png)) from the top menu and select
the *Applications* tab. You can either browse through the categories of
available apps until you find the one you're looking for or you can search for
apps by name. Once you've found an app, click the *Add* button to add it to the
current page. Once it's been added to the page, you can drag it to a new
position. Alternatively, you can drag the app directly from the Applications
menu to a specific location on the page. Follow the steps below to add some
Collaboration apps to the Lunar Resort site.

1. From the top menu, select *Add* &rarr; *Applications*.
2. In the menu that appears, expand the *Collaboration* category.
3. Drag the *Blogs Aggregator* app from the Add Application window to the right
   column of your page.
4. Next, drag the *Wiki* app to the left column.

See how easy it is to add applications to your pages? You've added the Wiki
app and Blogs Aggregator app to a page. 

![Figure 6: Your page layout options are virtually limitless with a slew of application and layout combinations.](../../../images/app-layout-design.png)

It's easy to make your pages look exactly the way you want them to. If the
default layout options provided aren't enough, you can even develop your own.
To find more information about developing custom layout templates, please refer
to the [Creating a Layout Template Project in the Plugins SDK](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-a-layout-template-project-in-the-plugins-sdk)
tutorial. 

<!-- TODO: Replace link above. -Cody -->

Next, you'll practice personalizing pages using page customizations!

## Personalizing Pages [](id=personalizing-pages)

Administrators can designate pages or sections of pages to be customizable. When
a user visits such a page, a notification appears stating that the user can
customize the page. Users can make customizations only in the sections of pages
designated by administrators. Customizations are based on the rows and columns
of a page layout. Page customizations are only visible to the user who made the
customizations. By default, site members can make page customizations but
non-site members and guests can't.

To enable page customizations as an administrator, first click *Configure Page*
from the *Options* button next to the Page you'd like to let site members
modify. Then select the *Advanced* tab at the top of the page, expand the
*Customization Settings* area, and click on the *Customizable* selector button. 

![Figure 7: To enable page customizations, click on the *Configure Page* button next to the page, expand the *Customization Settings* area, and click on the *Customizable* button.](../../../images/page-customizations.png)

Once you've enabled the *Customizable* selector, you can select the sections of
the page you'd like to enable customization for, depending on the layout
template of your page. Enable one or more of the *Customizable* sections to
allow site members to customize certain sections of the page. Regions that
you've designated as customizable are colored blue.

When site members visit your customizable page, they'll see an extended Control
Menu with a notification saying *You can customize this page*. Site members can
toggle whether to view or hide the customizable regions. If you toggle the
selector to view customizable regions, the regions on the page are color-coded
to help distinguish customizable vs. non-customizable sections of the page.

![Figure 8: Customizable regions are colored green and non-customizable regions are colored red.](../../../images/color-coded-customizable-regions.png)

Site members can also choose between viewing their customized page and viewing
the default page by selecting the *Options* button
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) from the Control Menu and
clicking the *View Page without my customizations* or *View My Customized Page*.

There's also a *Reset My Customizations* option available from the *Options*
button that restores a user's customized page to match the default page. This
allows users to discard one set of customizations and start a new set without
having to manually undo each customization that they'd previously made.

Note that non-administrator site members can access the Add menu from the top
right side of the screen when viewing their customizable page even if they don't
ordinarily have permission to view this menu. This allows them to add apps to
the sections of the page that they're allowed to customize. If they click *View
Page without my customizations*, the Add menu will disappear from the menu since
they're not allowed to modify the default page.

Administrators of customizable pages have the same two views as site members:
the *default page* view and the *customized page* view. Changes made to the
default page affect all users, whereas changes made to the customized page
affect only the administrator who made the changes. Changes made by
administrators to non-customizable sections in the default view are immediately
applied for all users. Changes made by administrators to customizable sections,
however, do *not* overwrite users' customizations.

Users can make two kinds of customizations to customizable regions. First, they
can configure applications within the customizable regions. Second, they can add
apps to or remove apps from the customizable regions.

![Figure 9: Customizable areas are highlighted green when organizing apps on the page.](../../../images/customizable-regions.png)

@product@ doesn't allow users to change a non-instanceable app's configuration
inside a customizable region since those kinds of apps are tied to the site to
which they've been added. If this were allowed, the customization would affect
all users, not just the one who customized the region. Therefore, changes to the
app configuration in a customizable region are only possible for instanceable
apps, whose app configuration only affects that one user.

For example, suppose that you, as an administrator, selected the right column of
the Welcome page of the Lunar Resort site to be customizable. A member of the
Lunar Resort site could take the following steps to make a personal
customization of the Welcome page:

1. Navigate to the Welcome homepage by clicking the Site Administration's
   *Site Selector* button (![Compass](../../../images/icon-compass.png)) and
   selecting the Lunar Resort site.
2. Add the Language Selector app to the right column of the page by clicking the
   *Add* icon, clicking on *Applications*, searching for *Language Selector*,
   and clicking *Add* next to its name.

The Language Selector application is useful to have on your homepage if you
expect users who speak different languages to access your instance. Users can
select their language in the Language Selector app to view a translation of your
site into their native language. After closing the Configuration dialog box of
the Language Selector app, the customized Welcome page looks like this:

To allow users to customize a page, administrators must grant users permission
to *Customize* pages under the Site section. This can be achieved by assigning
permission to a role, then assigning this role to the appropriate users. For
example, if you want any logged user to be able to customize your customizable
pages, you could assign the *Customize* permission to the role *User*. If you
want site members to be able to customize the customizable pages of their sites,
you would accept the default setting. By default, the *Customize* permission is
assigned to the role *Site Member*.

In addition to granting the ability to customize app configurations, the
*Customize* permission allows users to customize the look and feel of apps
and to import or export app settings. Next, you'll look at how to change page
permissions.

## Changing Page Permissions [](id=changing-page-permissions)

By default, public pages are just that: public. They can be viewed by anybody,
logged in or not logged in. And private pages are really only private from
non-members of the site. If someone has joined your site or is a member of your
organization, that person can see all the private pages. You can, however,
modify the permissions on individual pages in either page group so only certain
users can view them.

Suppose you want to create a page only for administrators to see. You can do
this with the following procedure:

1. Go to your site's Site Administration dropdown and select *Navigation* &rarr;
   *Private Pages*. If you don't have the *Private Pages* option available,
   select the *Options* button next to Public Pages and click *Add Private
   Page*. Remember, these pages by default are viewable only by members of the
   site.
2. Create a page called *Admin Tips*.
3. Click *Configure Page* from the Options button dropdown for the page in the
   left menu.
4. Select *Permissions* from the *Options* icon
   (![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the top right corner of the
   screen.
4. Uncheck the *View* and *Add Discussion* permissions next to the Site Member
   role.
5. Click the *Save* button.

Congratulations! You've changed the permissions for this page so only site
administrators can view it. Any users you add to this role can now see the page.
Other users, even members of this site, won't have permission to see it.

Pages in @product@ are as flexible as pages you'd create manually without a
Liferay instance. Using a point and click interface, you can define your site
any way you want. You can create and remove pages, export and import them, set
their layouts, define how they are indexed by search engines, and more.

You now understand how to manage pages in @product@. It's time to move on
to further customizing those pages for mobile devices and building standardized
pages using custom templates.
