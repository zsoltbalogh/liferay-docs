# Using @product@ as a collaborative platform [](id=using-liferay-portal-as-a-collaborative-platform)

@product@ includes a suite of collaborative applications, and they're all
integrated together. 

These applications range from personal productivity applications like a calendar
and email, to community-building applications like message boards, blogs, and
wikis. 

![Figure 1: @product@'s message boards are as fully featured as any standalone forum application, with the added benefit that they're integrated with the rest of the system.](../../images/01-message-boards.png)

This is a suite of integrated applications with all the features of similar,
standalone applications. For example, @product@'s Message Boards include
categories and subcategories, message threads, captcha, RSS feeds, email
notification, posting via email, and much more. But more than this, the
applications are integrated with the rest of @product@'s framework. Users
log in and their profiles are used automatically by the message boards and all
the other collaborative applications. And as you'll see later, functionality from
the built in applications can be added to your own to provide features like
comments in your own software, and you don't have to write any code to do it. 

One important feature of all the collaborative applications---as well as web
content and documents---is the Recycle Bin. If users delete content that must
be restored later, you don't have to find it in your backups: it's in the
Recycle Bin.

@product@'s suite of collaborative applications includes a Blog (complete
with blog aggregation features so you can publish multiple users' blog entries
in one place), Message Boards, a Wiki, a Knowledge Base that you can use to
publish a library of articles, activities display, and personal productivity
applications like a calendar.

@product@ includes what you need to enable users to collaborate. Next, you'll
see how @product@'s platform benefits developers.
