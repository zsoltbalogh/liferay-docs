# Conclusion: What @product@ Really Is [](id=conclusion-what-product-really-is)

So what is @product@? As you can see, it's hard to describe, because it does so
much. What we've essentially done is say it's a totally awesome content and
document managing, user collaborating, socially enabling, application
developing, corporate integrating, completely customizable platform for building
the Internet. If we'd said that up front, you may have thought we were
exaggerating. Hopefully now you can see that we really believe it, and we
continue striving to make @product@ better and better. 

But please don't take our word for it.
