# Extending and customizing Liferay for your own needs [](id=extending-and-customizing-liferay-for-your-own-needs)

@product@ was specifically designed to be extended and modified, beyond what
even most open source projects provide. Though its source code is available,
@product@'s developers have created many extension points so you don't have to
customize the source to make @product@ yours. 

The first (and easiest) way of customizing parts of @product@ is with
Application Display templates. These let you change the way built-in
applications look. For example, if you don't like the Documents and Media
Library's file manager view with large icons, you can create an Application
Display template that shows documents in some other view. If you don't like the
layout of the Blogs application, you can change it so that it has the look you
want. 

@product@ goes far beyond this, though. Special software components called
*modules* enable developers to change Liferay's interface and behavior without
having to modify any of @product@'s source code. This provides you all the
benefits of building your site from scratch, but without all the effort to
actually build from scratch. If you want to make a change to the user
registration screens, add support for a proprietary single sign-on mechanism
that you've written, add a feature to the message boards application or
anything else, you can make those customizations. And if you're a developer,
you know that it's a whole lot easier to customize something that almost does
things the way you want than it is to write that feature from scratch.
