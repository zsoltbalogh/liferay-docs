# What is @product@? [](id=what-is-liferay)

Choosing a platform for your web presence can be daunting. You want something
built on a solid technology foundation, fully featured, fully customizable, easy
to use, with a solid record of success, and a forward-looking, bright vision for
your site's future. If you're a small organization, the interface should be
intuitive enough and the defaults safe enough for you to get your site up
quickly, so you can focus on your mission instead of your technology. If you're
a large organization, your marketers should be able to update your site's
content easily, your developers should have a solid platform on which to build
your applications, and your administrators should have all the tools necessary
to manage the system and connect it to your existing environment. 

You've just found all that in @product@. 

@product@ provides a robust *platform* to build your site on quickly and serve
it to all clients---desktop, mobile, or anything in between. It provides all the
standard *applications* you need your site to run. It provides an easy to use
development *framework* for new applications or customization. On top of this,
@product@ is developed using an open source methodology, by people from around
the world. The code base is solid, reliable, and stable in mission critical
deployments in diverse industries.
