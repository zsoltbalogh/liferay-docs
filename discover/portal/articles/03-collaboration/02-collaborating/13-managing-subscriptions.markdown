# Managing Subscriptions [](id=managing-subscriptions)

Message Boards, Blogs, and Wikis, oh my! There are a lot of assets that you can 
subscribe to in @product@, and keeping track of all your subscriptions can be a 
job. Thanks to the My Subscriptions app, available on 
[Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace), 
you can manage all your subscriptions from one app.

Add the app to a page and your subscriptions are listed underneath their 
corresponding asset type.

Each subscription has an Actions menu that lets you *View*, *View in Popup*, 
and *unsubscribe* from the asset. You can unsubscribe from multiple 
subscriptions by selecting the checkbox next to the assets you want to 
unsubscribe from and clicking the *Unsubscribe* button. Alternatively you can 
unsubscribe from all subscriptions of a specific asset type by selecting the 
checkbox for the asset type (e.g. *Message Boards Category*) and clicking the 
*Unsubscribe* button.
