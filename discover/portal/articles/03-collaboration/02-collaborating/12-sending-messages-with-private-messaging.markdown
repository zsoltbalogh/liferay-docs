# Sending Messages with Private Messaging [](id=sending-messages-with-private-messaging)

The Private Messaging app lets you send email-like messages to other users. Its
interface is similar to an email client. Messages are aggregated by thread, with
the most recent message displayed. You can mark messages as read or unread or
delete them.

**Note:** There is a known issue, [LPS-69331](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-69331), 
which causes the Private Messaging app to be treated as a brand-new module 
during the initial upgrade process. This issue is fixed in Liferay fixpack de-10.

The Private Messaging app must be installed from Marketplace. Once installed,
the app must be added to a user's private *Dashboard* page. Now that you know
where you can get the app and where to place it, you're probably eager to write
messages. This is covered next.

## Composing Messages [](id=composing-messages)

Once the app is added to a user's Dashboard page, click the *New Message* 
button to compose a new message. Just like email, you can enter a subject, 
a message body, and add attachments. In the *To* field, an autocomplete
recipient list of users appears that lets you select who to send your message
to. You can select any number of users.

By default, all users are available in this list. You can filter the available
list of users by configuring the app. This is covered next.

## Configuring System Settings [](id=configuring-system-settings)

You can filter the set of available users in the *To* field's autocomplete
recipient list by social connection, status, or site membership. This
configuration, however, must be done by an administrator who has access to the
Private Messaging portlet's system settings.

To access the Private Messaging portlet's system settings, open the Control 
Panel, navigate to *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings*, and click 
*Private Messaging Service* under the *Other* tab.

The following settings filter the autocomplete recipient list of users for the
Private Messaging portlet:

**Autocomplete recipient type:** Filters the scope of users that appear in the 
autocomplete recipient list of the message's *To* field. Note that although this 
setting restricts the autocomplete recipient list of users, you can still send a 
private message to a user if you know his or her user name. The default value is
`all`.  Possible values are listed below:

- `all`: displays all users across your installation in the autocomplete
  recipient list.
- `connection`: displays only social connections in the autocomplete recipient 
  list.
- `site`: displays only fellow site members in the autocomplete recipient list.

**Autocomplete recipient site excludes:** Sets specific sites to exclude from
the autocomplete recipient list when **Autocomplete recipient type** is set to
`site`. This is especially useful if you have a default site that all users
belong to, but you still want to filter the autocomplete recipient user list 
by site. That site is then ignored when determining the users that are available
in the autocomplete recipient list.
