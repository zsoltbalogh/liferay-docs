# Inviting Members to Your Site [](id=inviting-members-to-your-site)

You've built a new site and now you need to get the word out about it. What 
better way to get the word out about your site then to invite users to join it. 
The Invite Members app lets you to do just that!

The Invite Members app is only visible to site administrators. It allows 
administrators to send invitations to users to join the site. Clicking the 
*Invite members to this site* button brings up the interface for sending out 
invitations.

Click the plus sign next to a user or click the *Add Email Address* button to 
add a user to the invite list. Users that have already been invited but have not 
yet responded are listed with a check mark next to their names. You can also
invite users to the *Site Owner*, *Site Content Reviewer*, and 
*Site Administrator* roles for your site by selecting that role under the 
*Invite to Role* heading. Once you've added all the users you want to 
invite and have selected any roles they should have, click the *Send
Invitations* button to invite them.

The site invitation shows up under the *Requests List* tab on the user's
*Notifications* page. The user can then choose to *Confirm* or *Ignore* the 
invitation.

**Note:** The Invitation app is also available as a deprecated app on the 
[Liferay Marketplace](http://liferay.com/marketplace). This app, unlike the
Invite Members app, lets you send an email invitation to a list of specified
email addresses. You can customize the email message for the invitation through
the portlet's Configuration menu.

This app is deprecated as of version 1.0.0.

When the invitation is confirmed, the user is made a member of the site and
assigned the roles you defined.
