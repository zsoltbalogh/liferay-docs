# Setting Up a @product@ Instance [](id=setting-up-a-liferay-instance)

Once you have a @product@ installation, you're going to want to configure it.
Whether that means adding a virtual instance, setting up the initial instance to
suit your needs, or integrating existing users into the installation. Recall
that configuration happens at different scopes. Here were thinking about the
instance scope. There's an important difference between the system scope and the
instance scope. The system scope is the highest level scope you can make
configurations at. All virtual instances of Liferay are impacted by
configuration done at this scope. The instance scope applies only to one
particular virtual instance of Liferay. What are virtual instances? Separate
Liferay installations (with their own virtual host) that share a server and
database. Each instance can be configured very differently.

So what kind of configuration do you need to do in your instance? Here's what
