# System Wide Settings [](id=system-wide-settings)

Liferay is so configurable it can be hard to keep track of where all the
configuration interfaces reside. Fortunately, the Control Panel is most often
the place to look, and there's a tidy *Configruation* section there that houses
a lot of the higher level (for example, system and instance scoped)
configuration options. This section considers the configuration options dealing
with the *System* scope. What is the system scope? It's the entire system, of
course. That might sound self explanatory, and it is, for the most part. It just
means that configuration at this level affects the entire system, which means
all the *Virtual Instances* of Liferay in the system. If you're not sure what a
Virtual Instance is, read the section on [Setting Up a Liferay
Instance](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/instance-settings/).

There are several configuration sections that take effect at the system scope:

- System Settings

- Server Administration

- Custom Fields
